         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, in that it was inſpired and witneſſed by the Holy Spirit of Truth into the Prophets and Apoſtles, and by them breathed forth and written, as the Holy Spirit gave them to ſpeak and write<note n="g" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11, 12. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.70. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15 4.</note>.

                     <note n="h" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</note>. But though the Narration of Sayings writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Scriptures were by Divine Inſpiration recorded, yet are there many Sayings recorded, which in reſpect of the Sayings themſelves were not Divine Inſpirations: but the Spirations and Sayings, ſome of Satan, ſome of Seducers and wicked men, ſome of weak Believers, ſome even of ſtrong Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers tempted; which were by the Inſpiration of God given to the Writers, and ſo by them recorded; but not recorded as the Inſpirations of God's Minde, but as God's Declaration of the Sayings of Satan or of Men, that we may know the ſubtilties of Satan, and beware; and the ſeducements and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of the wicked, and take heed; and ſo the weakneſs of ſome, and frame of Spirit in others: and ſo ſuch Sayings are to be taken, as God's Declarations of the Deeds and Sayings of others, to warn, inſtruct us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not as his own Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to be received, obeyed, and built on as true and good; that would be an abuſe of them. But as for the Goſpel it ſelf (that is, the Teſtimony of Chriſt) even All of it, was not onely narrated by Divine Inſpiration, or given of God by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration to be narrated, as thoſe things that were indeed ſpoken or done by Satan, or wicked or weak men: But as the very Things, Sayings, Spirations, and Inſpirations of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, of his own Minde; and ſo it is Divine Truth, Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, divinely inſpired, as well as by Divine Inſpiration writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and recorded; and therefore True: not only true it was

                  <p>For, 1. By Chriſt in whom we believe, we mean not, An Imagination or Frame; but, the ſecond publick Man, the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135210:15"/>ſpiritual Man, who not only out of us, but before we in our Perſons were, and without any Motion or In-being in us, did himſelf take our Nature, being conceived by, and born of a Woman, a Virgin, that was of the natural Seed and Lineal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Adam;</hi> and ſo took a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Body of his own, in which he bore our ſins on the Tree, and was made a Curſe, and died for us, and overcame Death, and ſhook off all Mortality without ſeeing corruption in that Body, in which being buried, he roſe again, and appeared to, and converſed with his Diſciples, and then in their ſight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them out of this World in that riſen Body, and ſo aſcended into Heaven, and offered himſelf a ſacrifice to God, and ſate down on his right Hand; and in that now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Body remaineth in Heaven a great High Prieſt, appearing before God ever-living to intercede for us. This is The Chriſt our Saviour, not to come to take fleſh, nor ſo coming, nor ſo in us: he hath done that already he was to do in his own Body for us, and can die no more, but is alive for evermore, immeaſurably filled with Spirit to ſend forth to us. The right knowing of him, is the original and right way of knowing all things; and right knowing and worſhipping of God, is in the Confeſſion of him, thus to be already come in the fleſh;<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3.</note> and that Spirit that denieth this, is the Spirit of Antichriſt; and he that denieth that This Jeſus is The Chriſt, he is Antichriſt,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22, 23.</note> and denieth the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p>And whoever believeth in This Jeſus, receiveth of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which imprinteth his Word, and frameth his Minde in his Heart, enriching him with his Conſolations; and ſo by Word,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But whoever believeth not in this Chriſt without them, and receiveth not the Efficacies and Frames within, from the excellency of the knowledge of, and Belief in him without, ſo as he that is without in bodily preſence, is within by ſpiritual preſence; but come to undervalue him as without them, and magnifie ſomething within them: All that within, is but meer deluſion, which the enſuing Diſcourſe will further ſhew: ſo that the voice of this Objection being ſo ſtrange, the ſheep will not hear it.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. That the Light of Truth, and Import to God's Minde to us in his ſayings, is the ſaying or ſentence it ſelf, and not often in the Etymology of every particular word; nor doth the Spirit of Light, &amp; force to enter the heart, lie in the force of the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology, and copious and various ſenſe of ſuch and ſuch a word, of ſo many Syllables, in ſuch and ſuch a Tongue, (as ſome would perſwade of ſome words, and therefore left them untranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) but in the Knowledge and Belief of the Teſtimony of Chriſt. And therefore, when words are uſed, which are of common and known ſignification, and alter not, but ſet forth the ſenſe as pertaining to the things of Chriſt in Tranſlation or Explication; it is all one and the ſame, being the import of his ſayings, which believed, the Light of his Spirit will go forth therein. And ſo, without amazing the people with ſome ſtrange ſenſe about the Etymology and ſignification of the word in the pure Hebrew or Greek, have thoſe that were infallibly led by the Holy Spirit done, (as the induſtrious Learned do know.)

It may be theſe ſayings were put in, to counſel and cautionate his Reader, that he takes not all he readeth upon truſt; and that he would have others, and will hereafter himſelf follow this Rule: and therefore, though he would not grant like Chriſtian Requeſts of mine, but went beſide all theſe Rules in dealing with a Treatiſe of mine; yet in Love and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Truth, I will grant and yield to all this, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to follow this Rule to the utmoſt of the Ability given me; and ſo deſire, that every Saying or Writing of mine, now, or heretofore written, (and ſo of others likewiſe) may be tried by the Teſtimony of Chriſt, and the plain Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thereof; and all that agreeth not thereto, I confeſs and renounce as a lye and deceit: and ſo I would have others to do.

And the like we may obſerve about Words in Scripture Sayings, that have ſome obſcurity, and one meaning in one Saying, and another meaning in another Saying; yet in like Sayings, the meaning of thoſe words is explicated by the Spirit that ſpake them, and hath been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and recorded by the Holy Prophets and Apoſtles, and may be underſtood by all that believe their writings, in comparing one place with another; ſo that we compare like Sayings, or Sayings of like things together; as, if the Sayings be of God &amp; of his Works of Creation, Redemption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by God ſaid; ſee the ſenſe of the Word, as given and explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in like Sayings; and compare not God with Men, to make

And theſe things obſerved, the Import of Sayings in Scripture, will not be ſo obſcure as many pretend.

And yet in all this is there no change in God: he, in his Love, is the ſame ſtill, though theſe ſinning Angels be fallen out of his Love under wrath and hatred; yea, it would rather have implied a change in God, if he had continued his Love on ſuch preſumptuous Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors.

And as for the Soveraignty of God, it is one and the ſame, and ever agreeing with his Wiſdom, Holineſs, Truth, Juſtice, Love and Purpoſe: ſo that change, by preſumptuous ſinning of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, from being under Love, to be under Hatred, argues no change in God. And this is clear in the caſe of the fallen Angels; that I ſay nothing of Mankinde changed from being under well-pleaſedneſs to be under wrath and diſpleaſure: though compaſſions were yet toward them, who ſinned all in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:135210:35"/>one, and by the ſubtilty of a Tempter; yet the change in Man great, in God none at all: which ſhews the vanity of the Pleas and Inferences of ſome, about, and from the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of God in his minde and purpoſes.</p>

                  <p>But yet for all this, there is ſuch an evil diſpoſition and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt the minde of God within Man, in the heart of Man, diffuſing it ſelf throughout all the powers of a Man, and ruling the Man, that without ſomething by all this done for Man without him, there be ſtill farther ſomething ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral done in him: Man of himſelf, though all this be told him, neither can nor will come in to God again at this door he hath opened: for, as may be ſeen in that ſaid in Chap. 10.</p>

And whatever any other may pretend to mean, yet that is the thing under conſideration, while that word Oblation is uſed in this buſineſs; otherwiſe, this word Oblation may be uſed for other offerings and other ſacrifices, as well as the word Ranſom is uſed, ſomtime for ranſoming by price, ſometime for ranſoming by ſtrong hand, ſomtime for procuring an intereſt in the ranſomed, ſomtime for freeing the ranſomed out of trouble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo the word Redemption ſomtime is uſed for redemption of a Friend by purchaſe, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for redemption out of the hands of an Enemy by ſtrong hand, ſomtime of the redeemed purchaſed or redeemed from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things by a price given to themſelves; ſomtime the word is uſed for redeeming Men of God, ſomtime for redeeming out of others unto God: ſo that the confounding theſe terms, and uſing them one for another, as all one in every ſentence where they are uſed, ſignifying one and the ſame manner of thing, is that by which the unwary are deceived, and ſtrife about words occaſioned, while the thing it ſelf is not ſtood to. I therefore have here expreſt my meaning, and ſo do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, and uſe this phraſe here, <hi>The Oblation of Chriſt;</hi> meaning thereby, <hi>His offering up himſelf a ſacrifice to God, to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and propitiation for the ſins of Men.</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:135210:51"/>Oblation and Sacrifice to God, and alſo that he was faithful in all his buſineſs: but that I note this for, is, that it may be minded, That Jeſus Chriſt in the buſineſs of his Oblation and Sacrifice-offering, he had to deal with God, and with none but with God; and though for fallen Mankinde, yet not with them, but with God for them. True it is, in his after-Mediation, (of which is after to be ſpoken) as he hath to deal for Men, ſo alſo both with God and with Men: but in his Oblation and Sacrifice-offering, though it was for Men, yet he did not in that deal with Men, but with God for them: true, in the fitting and preparing his Body, which he took to offer, he did deal with the Nature (though not with the Perſons) of Mankinde, in that he took fleſh of the Seed of a Woman, that was of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and had thereof his Body framed, which he took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to union of perſon with himſelf; ſo, that the Man Chriſt is God Man, the Son of God. And this alſo is true, That walking on the Earth in that Body, in his Miniſtration of the Goſpel, and mercies, and miracles extended, he dealt with Men to do them good; yea, as there were ſeveral ends in his death, one to make propitiation for ſins, one to confirm the Teſtament of precious promiſes, and one to bear witneſs of the Truth he had taught, and therein ſhew his love and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as a Miniſter and true and faithful Shepherd, his love and faithfulneſs to his Hearers, which were his ſheep: and as in reſpect of the firſt End, not the Scribes and Phariſees, but God laid on him the iniquity of us all, and delivered him to death for our ſins; and in reſpect of the ſecond End, he willingly gave up the Ghoſt and died, as for our ſins, ſo to confirm the New Teſtament in his Blood: ſo, in reſpect of the third End, the Prieſts, Scribes and Phariſees envying and hating him for his Goſpel preaching, did crucifie him and put him to death; which alſo he willingly under went, to witneſs the Truth as he had taught, as hath been more lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The diſſimilitudes are ſo evident between the typical High-Prieſts, and our High-Prieſt,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:135210:58"/>that I need but only mention them: thoſe of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> ours of the Tribe of <hi>Judah:</hi> thoſe after the Law of a carnal Commandment, ours after the power of endleſs Life: thoſe after the Order of <hi>Aaran,</hi> and without an Oath; ours after the Order of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> and with an Oath: thoſe had in themſelves inherency of ſin, and perſonal ſins, needing a Sacrifice for themſelves; ours holy, ſinleſs, had no ſin either perſonal or inherent, needing any Sacrifice for himſelf: thoſe, by reaſon of death, had Succeſſors; ours liveth and remaineth a High-Prieſt for ever: their Prieſthood and Law was change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; our Prieſt and his Law abideth for ever: their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Purifications did but ſanctifie and purifie the fleſh, and made nothing perfect, no, not the comers thereto, though, and therefore often iterated; but the Sacrifice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and Purification made at once by our High-Prieſt, was perfect, and makes all comers to it perfect, purifying the Hearts and Conſcience of them. Theſe, and ſuch-like diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes are ſet forth to us in this Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and other places; by all which, Chriſt is ſhewn to excel all that figured and typed him: and ſo, in the fulfilling of Truth in every ſimilitude, in which the types did figure him, he not only anſwereth, but excelleth in the fulneſs of Truth: and ſo in theſe of the Prieſts, he was truly Man, yea, an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and perfect Man; and though in a ſupernaturàl way, yet of the Race of Mankinde: and he was immediately called to this Office by God, and he hath had experience of humane weakneſſes, ſorrows and temptations; and he laid aſide his Glory he had with the Father before the World was, till in the Garments of meanneſs and innocency, he had made the Atonement, and then was clothed with his former Glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; he once in the end of the World hath made the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with his own Blood; and by vertue of his own Blood, hath entred into the Heavens, and obtained E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Redemption.

None of theſe places countenancing either of theſe expreſſions, and ſome contradicting them cleerly. And it's before ſhewn, how Scripture plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, That Jeſus Chriſt, as the publick Man, is by vertue of his ſufferings, and Oblation offered to God, glorified with the Glory, he, as the Son of God, had with the Father before the World was; and, That he is made, The Chriſt; and, The Lord of all, The Saviour of the World, The Head of the Church, The Mediator between God and Men, The great High-Prieſt; yea, all Power and Authority is given to him; yea, Power to give Repentance and Remiſſion of ſins, to open blinde eyes, to communicate the Priviledges of ſons, to raiſe the Dead, and to judge all Men according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and to give rewards to his Servants the Saints both ſmall and great; to ſit on the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and ſet his ſuffering-Saints on Thrones with him: and all this, the Fruit of the Death, Oblation and Purchaſe of Chriſt; and attained by him, and to be believed. O let not Believers be ſo puff'd up, to think all this muſt be beſtowed on them! all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is againſt it: let none ſuffer himſelf by ſuch dangerous Expreſſions to be occaſioned to fall into the Condemnation of the evil Angels that were not content with their place. But let this be waved, as not intended, though the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on giveth Ground for it; and waving this, the Expreſſion is waved as falſe and dangerous: but take it in the beſt ſenſe we can, it is a confeſſed Truth, That the Gifts of Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Evangeliſts, The viſible deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt, The Gifts of ſpeaking with divers Tongues, The Gifts of Miracles, were all fruits and effects of the Death, Oblation and Purchaſe of Chriſt, as hath been ſhewn in plain Texts, and were procured by him into himſelf, to be beſtowed as Fruits of his Death, before we believed. And the Spirit ſaith, <hi>That all theſe are not given</hi> (not only not to every one for whom Chriſt died, but even not) <hi>to every Believer and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:135210:69"/>of the Church.</hi> So, that this Expreſſion, as it's derogatory to Chriſt, ſo it is contradictory to the plain Teſtimony of the Spirit in the Scripture. But let leave be given to wave this, though the Expreſſion will not admit the waving it, ſeeing theſe are things by ſome attained to, and to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But if no more is meant, but thoſe Graces neceſſary to ſonſhip and eternal ſalvation, yet the Expreſſion croſſeth the plain ſayings of the Goſpel ſtill, that intimate to us the periſhing of ſome for whom Chriſt died; and hath plainly foretold us, <hi>That ſome will deny the Lord that bought them:</hi> yea, the Scripture ſetteth forth the Death, Oblation, and Purchaſe of Chriſt, as the Ground of the Lordſhip of Chriſt, and of his raiſing the Dead, and of the Equity of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the Goſpel; which is all denied by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                     <p>And yet here is more confuſion and darkneſs in this Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in a miſtake of that for what Chriſt offered himſelf a ſacrifice to God, if not a ſhort coming alſo in that which he offered: ſurely in his paying the debt he died, that is true; and yet here is more than ſimply Death, in the Oblation giving, or Ranſom, or Sacrifice; even Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and giving himſelf to God: that which he gave and offered to God for us, was himſelf, his own Body, as is foreſhewn. And that for which he gave himſelf, was, for Men, for ſinners, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for us, even for our ſins, to take them away; and for our nature, and perſons, to purchaſe us into his diſpoſe, as is fully ſhewn and proved. True, if there had been any that God had choſen, and given to Chriſt to die for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> intimates in ſome of his Expreſſions; then they were God's Elect, and Chriſt his peculiar by donation of the Father before his Death, and ſo his Death and Oblation could not be for them to purchaſe them, or that they ſhould be his by vertue of that Oblation and Purchaſe of his, ſeeing they were his Father's Elect, and his by gift before; no need to buy after, that which was given before; therefore it muſt not be for them, but for ſomething elſe for them. And what that is, Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Expreſſion hinteth, and in other his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings he expreſſeth, as if <hi>Chriſt in giving himſelf to God, did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of his Father, by his Death and Sacrifice, certain Graces of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:135210:70"/>Repentance, Faith, Love, and other ſpiritual Gifts, to be beſtowed on ſome certain perſons fore-given him to die for.</hi> That ſuch gifts are the effects and fruits of the Death and Oblation of Chriſt, is true and granted, becauſe he by his Oblation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured that power and furniture (when he purchaſed us, and an Inheritance for all that believe on him) by which he giveth and worketh theſe Graces, though purchaſing ſuch Graces be no Scripture-phraſe: and yet this is ſtill more unſcripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, in intimating, as if all theſe Graces and Fruits were not in the Hands of Chriſt to beſtow, though purchaſed by him; but depoſited into the Hands of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Very true, for they are all depoſited in to the Man Chriſt, <hi>in whom the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth bodily,</hi> Col. 2.3, 9, 10.

                        <note n="f" place="margin">Pag. 216. Sect. 3.</note>. This is a very dark ſaying, and tending to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found things diſtinct: for ſure the Oblation is already accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, his Death over and paſt, and he alive for evermore: but the vertue of his Death, and ſo of his Oblation, abideth; but the efficacy is that here to be minded: and its efficacy with God is ſeen in this, that he hath made Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, filled him with all fulneſs of the Holy Ghoſt, given all Power and Authority into his Hands, to diſpoſe of all Men, to raiſe the Dead, and to judge all. All this is given him, as the effect of his Death and Oblation: and for this he neither doth nor needeth to make Interceſſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the making the efficacies of Oblation - Offerings, and Interceſſion-making, as both one, without any real difference in the actual accompliſhment, is not right. Beſides, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of his Interceſſion with God is by vertue of his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation-fore-accompliſhed, and with, and in the Furniture by it obtained, and it alwayes, and in all things for all he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth, prevaileth with God, and ſo he obtaineth the making
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:135210:71"/>known of his Oblation, and the Vertues thereof for Men, and the Extention of many Means, and Mercies, and ſpiritual Operations to them, all which are the efficacies of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion with God for Men. But now the efficacies, with, and in Men are various: ſome, receiving, and ſo meeting freely with bleſſing; others, refuſing, and upon that account con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned (not that he intercedeth for their Condemnation, but) for their refuſal of Mercies, extended by the Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him that had fore-bought them. The efficacy of his Oblation is, in that they are given into his diſpoſe, and he is their Lord, and ſhall be their Judge; which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid: and this obtained before Interceſſion made. The efficacy of his Interceſſion, by vertue of his Oblation, is ſeen in the Patience, Forbearance, Mercy, Means, and Spirit extended to Men, to bring them in to be his peculiar People: and its efficacy in Men, is in their believing, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but in their diſobedient refuſal, heavy, even tending to juſt Condemnation: the manner of Chriſt's judging, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the Mercies and Means he hath extended, as Men have received or rejected. And beſides, in thoſe that do receive the Grace extended for his Interceſſion, it is not all one, and ſo prevalent in and with the beſt of Saints on Earth, nor ſo abundantly efficacious with them, as it hath been and is with God: ſuch thoughts, I hope, are far from us, and not intended in the Expreſſion: but the Expreſſion being Scriptureleſs,<note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> and not agreeing to the Rule, I leave it.</p>

                     <p>As for thoſe Expreſſions of Chriſt dying for his Elect, ſeeing that there could be none elect in him, but as he is beheld, as having died &amp; offered his Oblation; nor is any of Mankinde reprobated, but as thus are beheld, rejecting him that offered

And ſo, though it be true, That Chriſt hath once died, and offered the Oblation, both for thoſe that now are elect, and thoſe that now are reprobated; and by vertue of the ſame Oblation will eternally ſave the one, and juſtly condemn the other: yet he died, and offered the Oblation for no Man as elect, nor for any Man as reprobated; but for all Men as ſinners fallen in <hi>Adam.</hi> Therefore that Expreſſion of dying for his elect, or dying for the reprobate, are neither the one nor the other found in the Holy Scriptures, but in the ſayings of thoſe that ſtrive to ſhun, or ſhadow the Light.

                     <p>The general Mediation and Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt is between God and Men. <hi>There is one God,</hi>

                        <hi>and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all Men.</hi> In which it is plain, That Jeſus Chriſt gave himſelf a Ranſom for all Men: not, <hi>That he is giving;</hi> but, <hi>Hath given himſelf a Ranſom for all.</hi> That work is done and finiſhed: and yet this is here alſo evident, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Ranſom given, and the Purgation and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement made, and the Redemption thereby obtained, and the Love and Mercy ſhewn through this Ranſom given in means to draw Men to God; Men are found ſinners ſtill upon another account,<note place="margin">

So then this is alſo plain,<note place="margin">

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:135210:86"/>in Application to Men, in extenſion of the Fruits and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to, and in Men, as to Mens diſcerning and enjoying, the vertne and efficacy of the Mediation and Interceſſion is firſt: though the Mediation be by vertue of the Oblation firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God, yet the Mediation fore-running the making of it known, and being that which procures the making known the Oblation and vertue of it unto Men; and alſo, it is through his Interceſſion and Diſpenſation according thereto, that the efficaciouſneſs of the Oblation is found in Men, yet the efficacy with and in Men, is various, and in and with no mortal Man, ſo full and compleat, as with God; and this appears cleerly in the Mediation and Interceſſion of Chriſt, who there-through prevailing with God, procureth and extendeth forth the knowledge of his Oblation, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof with God for Men, in all that he hath ſuffered and done for us in the Nature of Man, and in the means uſed towards us in the Declaration of his Word, and in Ordinances, Mercies, Chaſtiſements, and Motions of Spirit, in Convincements and Allurements, to break Man off his purpoſe, and ſubdue him to ſelf-denial, and ſo bring him in to believe on Chriſt, and ſo to Peace and Life; and alſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in diſcovering the Father's Love, and rich Grace, and gracious Ends, in giving him, and accepting his Oblation, and making him the Mediator; and now for his Mediation, extending ſo much patience and ſo many means, all ſanctified by his Blood, to draw Men from their own ovil deſigns and wayes in ſins, or righteouſneſs of their own, to receive his Grace and Favour.</p>
                     <p>And in this Fruit of his Interceſſion by vertue of his Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he being the Man, the Word that was made Fleſh, and ſhed his Blood, and by vertue thereof, is now through theſe means ſprinkling it; and his Father being that Fountain of Love and living Waters, that ſent him, and hath filled him with himſelf, his Face ſhining in his: It in all appears, not only that his Mediation and Inteceſſion is excellent, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, That this Love of the Father in giving him, and his Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered, and Mediation by vertue thereof, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the extention of the Fruits of God's Love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through, is, the Water and Blood by which he came, and the way in which the Spirit beareth witneſs of him: and ſo alſo
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:135210:86"/>the Water and Spirit, of which Believers are born. And hence alſo it is, That all thoſe means extended to Men in the Love of God, as procured by the Interceſſion of Chriſt by vertue of his Oblation to ſo gracious an end; they are the Cords of a Man, proceeding from the Man Chriſt, and ſuited to the needs and capacities of Men to whom extended,<note place="margin">

But he did all this alone, and in that reſpect is the Root and Fountain of Election alſo: ſo, that the Elect are beholding to the Oblation and Interceſſion of Chriſt, for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, as well as for Faith: yea, and they believe, That Chriſt interceded for theſe men alſo that they might believe: but that was before they were perſonally Elect; and ſo then not for them, as they were Elect, which then was not, nor were they ſuch; but as they were Men of the World, and Tranſgreſſors, that means might be extended to them, and they ſo brought to believe;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13.</note> and in this believing of the Truth, choſen through the Sanctification of the Spirit; which is God's Way.

                     <p>FOr the coming again of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, it being one part of the Teſtimony of Chriſt, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alſo, to be known and believed; it being alſo of the very Object of Faith, ſet forth in the Goſpel to be believed; ſo, as without believing it, no Man's Faith is compleat and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, in reſpect of the Object of Faith, or Doctrine of the Goſpel to be believed: yet before I proceed in treating of it, it is good to conſider what manner of coming it is, that is here ſpoken of, becauſe divers comings are ſpoken of in the Scripture, though never but of two perſonal and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily comings:</p>
                     <p>The firſt called, His coming in the Fleſh, in Abaſements to ſuffer, and overcome in ſufferings, and ſo to offer the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sacrifice; and ſo to make the Atonement, obtain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, receive Spirit in the Man, and ſit on the right hand of God, as the Mediator and great High-Prieſt, and Prophet, and King, to ſend forth Spirit to Men, of which is

The true Spirit confeſſeth this. And of this coming is ſpoken in the former two Heads of his Oblation and Mediation, by vertue of his Oblation; all his ſtretching forth his power in providential Comings, in Mercies and Judgements, and in gracious Viſitations or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Comings, are the effects and fruits of his Oblation and Interceſſion in his Adminiſtration in his bodily Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>But the ſecond and next perſonal and bodily coming of Chriſt, is in Glory, and to take unto him his great Power and Raign, and to receive to himſelf, to raign with him, all that have believed on him, and ſuffered with him<note n="b" place="margin">

I determine not things to be done according to my expreſſions: but ſuch-like things, and in a true ſenſe, according to the expreſſions of the Scripture quoted, will be done; yea, even ſo, that it will be done to them, like as it was to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> So that when the 45 yeers are out, is eaſie to be known: but when they begin, whether at their firſt aſſay to enter, or in their beginning to ſettle; I know not: but could I ſurely know of the leaſt beginning of theſe things, I ſhould as aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly know the Lord is ſo nigh coming, as that (as one might ſay) he is riſen up and on his march; and if the 45 yeers be not entred, they will preſently enter. So for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and now for our ſelves that are not natural <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we may learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for our information, about the time of the coming of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:135210:102"/>our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Cnriſt, in comparing the things and events coming to paſs, with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, from their coming out of <hi>Egyyt</hi> unto the firſt coming of Chriſt, with the things and events coming to paſs with and among Chriſtians from the firſt coming of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 10.18. <hi>&amp; verſ.</hi> 1.6 11.</note> to the ſecond and glorious coming of Chriſt, we are in many things willed to behold <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> after the fleſh; and they are affirmed to be figures and examples for us, and thoſe things to be written for our warning and inſtruction: and concerning God's dealing with them, in giving them the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and their demeanor towards him; Chriſt uttered a Parable, which may be read <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.33, 34. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.9-17. and ſo for his dealing with Chriſtians, from firſt to ſecond coming, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour towards him, he uttered a like Parable, which may be read <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.14-30. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.12-27. Therefore it it is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to conſider and compare the ſame things in reading the Hiſtories of them, and we may diſcern, there is, hath been, and will be ſome Agreement.</item>

When God by <hi>Moſes</hi> the Mediator, gave them the Law, and ſet their Prieſthood, Sacrifices, and Temple-worſhip in order, the people were generally, and many of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Levites, ſtubborn and rebellious all the dayes of the perſonal Miniſtration of <hi>Moſes:</hi> ſo in the dayes of the perſonal Miniſtration of Chriſt the Mediator of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, while he was miniſtring the Goſpel, and working Miracles to ſave the loſt ſheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom in Miniſtration, he was eſpecially ſent, yet while he was chuſing Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and giving them his Goſpel and his Ordinances to have miniſtred to them, yet were the people generally, with their High-Prieſt, and Prieſts, and Lawyers, ſtubborn and rebellious, and but few of them that came in to believe on him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s time, when <hi>Moſes</hi> was taken away, the people were more generally obedient, and followed the Lord more fully; (though ſome trouble by <hi>Achan.</hi>) And ſo in the dayes of the Elders that out-lived <hi>Joſhuah.</hi> So in the Apoſtles and firſt Witneſſes dayes, (after Chriſt left the World, and went to the Father) both Jews and Gentiles came in apace; &amp; the Churches encreaſed and proſpered, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:135210:102"/>grew in Grace, and kept the Faith ſound; notwithſtanding ſome harm done by falſe Prophets; for the Spirit of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt began, even before their departure, to work; yet the Churches kept the Faith ſound in their dayes, and in the days of the Churches of thoſe firſt times that next ſucceeded them, and received the Goſpel from their perſonal Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. After <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s time, and the time of the Elders that out-lived <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> the people learned the manners of the Nations, and went a whoring after their Gods, and God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them often into the hands of their Oppreſſors; yet in mercy ever and anon in their diſtreſſes, be raiſed them up Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours or Judges. So after the time of the Apoſtles and firſt Witneſſes, and the time of the Churches next ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding them, (according as the Apoſtles had foretold) wolves did enter in among them, and men ſpeaking perverſe things, roſe up among them; and ſomething now they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, to adorn them with the Wiſdom and Learning of the Gentiles, in Philoſophy, and other ſuch-like Arts, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Speech, as the Gentiles gloried in; and likewiſe with ſuch worldly Excellencies, and Superiorities, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities for Church-Order and Offices, as might ſuit the ſame; and ſo humane Traditions and Superſtitions begun to ſpring up; and God deeply chaſtned them, and ſuffered the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to load them with many Perſecutions: yet in their cries he ſtill gave them ſome Deliverances, and preſerved to them many good and faithful Teachers.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="5">5. After <hi>Iſrael</hi> had long enjoyed theſe flouriſhing times, they grew full, and fell into Diviſions; and then ten Tribes rent from the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and fell to ſuperſtition, in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:135210:103"/>worſhipping <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Calves, and after to more groſs I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry in worſhipping <hi>Baal,</hi> till they were carried away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Captivity, and are not yet returned: but <hi>Iudah</hi> ſtill wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the true God, though polluted with many defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Superſtition: ſo the Chriſtian Churches af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while of enjoyment of theſe flouriſhing times, grew full, and through pride and covetouſneſs of their Biſhops, aſpiring for pre-eminence, fell into many Sects and Diviſions: and what Diviſions in Churches, and between the Churches Eaſt and Weſt, is by many recorded; till many Churches that were famous in the firſt times, had their Candleſticks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and <hi>Mahometans</hi> now poſſeſs their place, and they are not to this day reſtored. The other Churches, ſpecially Weſtward, ſtill retained the Faith, though defiled with many humane inventions and ſuperſtitions.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. After <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Captivity, yet <hi>Iudah</hi> repented not of the defilements among them: but, though for a while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing with God, yet by degrees they fell to provoke him ſo with their Idolatries, that he cauſed them alſo to be carried away Captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> for threeſcore and ten yeers; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo after the removal of ſo many Churches Eaſtward, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Churches VVeſtward did not repent of their defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with humane inventions and ſuperſtitions, nor of the pride and covetouſneſs of their Biſhops; and though for a time they held the Faith, yet by degrees they fell to more ſuperſtitions; ſo, as they provoked God, and made way for the Man of ſin, till he got his Seat in the Temple of God, and therewith a worldly power alſo, and ſo exaited himſelf above all that hath Imperial Majeſty; and ſo God being provoked, left the outward Court into the hands of the Gentiles; and being filled with Idolatry and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, the Holy City is by them trodden under foot, 1260 yeers: all which time, the VVitneſſes propheſie in Sack-cloth, and all the upright are as Captives in <hi>Babylon,</hi> myſterious <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:135210:103"/>Prophets, and ſo they proſpered for a time: ſo the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans after the firſt coming forth from the groſs darkneſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, and Tyranny of the Man of ſin, endeavoured col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and reformation of Churches; and held forth the Goſpel according to the expreſs and plain import of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or words of the Scripture; and for a time (though in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution) they proſpered, and the word of the Lord grew and encreaſed.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. After this, the Jews fell no more to the Idolatry of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> or of <hi>Baal,</hi> nor to any willing or openly profeſſed Idolatry of the Heathen; yea, they were zealous againſt it: but in their zeal, they ran into many over-ſtrict Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome part of the Law, and over-looſe in ſome other parts of it; and found out many Inventions and Devices, pretending to Humility, Devotion, and Holineſs, which they took on them to obſerve, and ſo by Tradition kept them, appearing herein very holy; and all that did not know and yield up to the ſame, they counted as ſinners, publicans, and prophane. And thus they continued, though under the Roman power, till the coming of Jeſus Chriſt. So after the coming forth from the Man of ſin, theſe reformed Churches fall no more to ſuch groſs Idolatries, but teſtifie againſt it: yet with their humane Learning and Wiſdom, they content not themſelves with the plain ſayings of the Goſpel, but ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſtrain for Interpretations; and ſo have framed by their School-Arts ſuch appearing-exquiſite Opinions, and Rules alſo for Church-Government, and certain Obſervations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to great ſtrictneſs, zeal, devotion, and holineſs: which, taken up as a Tradition from one to another, muſt be maintained and obſerved; and they that do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame, are counted either factious or prophane. And thus they continue till neer the coming of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. After the Jews had ſome Generations walked thus, God ſent among them <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> in the Spirit and power of <hi>Elias,</hi> the immediate fore-runner of the Lord's firſt coming, by whom the way of the Lord was prepared, and many diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled for the acknowledgement of him; but thoſe zealous ones received him not, but rejected him, though divers Sects among themſelves, Phariſees, Sadduces and Herodians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p n="10">10. When the Jews had had their time, and God dealt thus with them, and their ſin ripened in oppoſing <hi>John,</hi> &amp;c. then came Jeſus Chriſt among them; but theſe great Ones oppoſed him alſo: ſo when the Gentiles have had their time, and God hath dealt thus with them, and their ſin is grown ripe in ſuch oppoſition of light, then comes Jeſus Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally with all his Saints; but the Beaſt and the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet will ſtand againſt him alſo: but he comes not then to ſuffer, but to raign; and ſo all the Enemies will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown: he coming to the ends aforeſaid.

Where is this new Heaven and new Earth? This Reſtauration of all things? This raigning of Chriſt and his Saints, you ſay, was promiſed to the Fathers; And, you have long called theſe the laſt dayes, and yet no ſuch things appears; you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled with ſome Enthuſiaſm, or Millenary-Opinion; you wait for a Fancy: one Generation goeth, and another cometh; all things continue as they were, and will ſo do.</p>
                     <p>We, in belief of the Teſtimony of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5.7.</note> may know theſe Men are willingly ignorant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may admire God's Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſuch, in forbearing them, that they might repent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming; and his patience towards us, that have not done all we might, to gain Men in to Repentance, that we might renew our Diligence: and we know a Day is not in God's account, as it is with Men; and that there are ſome things ſtill to be performed that muſt be done before his coming: and the being tried with ſuch Scoffers is one thing, in which we ſee the Truth of his Word that foretold it; and

And ſo we know by the ſame Rule, That all the Horns or ten Kingdoms, do not yet hate the Whore; and though there is a good beginning, and in ſome places her Fleſh eaten, yet not by them all; nor have they yet burnt her with Fire, nor are the Jews yet come into their own Land; yea, <hi>Euphrates</hi> is not yet dried up: all which muſt firſt be.

Some, ſuch as theſe, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in the Apoſtles times, though the Spirit of Antichriſt did but begin then to work. But we that believe the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus Chriſt, do know, That Jeſus, that very Man, is The Chriſt; and, That his very being come in the Fleſh, and that he hath done therein and thereby, is the Foundation of our Faith and Hope, and the way and door of our approach to God; and that through which all Mercies are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: yea, even the Spirit it ſelf: yea, this it is which the Holy Ghoſt (whoſe work it is) glorifieth to the Heart, and ſo enables to believe in Chriſt, and unites and frames to him thereby, and ſo to confeſs him come in the Fleſh, which none can do but by the Holy Spirit, which is Chriſt his ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, and ſo coming to them, and dwelling in them by Spirit: in which he was never abſent from Believers, ſince the beginning of the World, though more abundantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent where he is more known, as declared ſince his Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Heaven: and this his preſence by Spirit in Believers, is the whole time of believing and living by Faith; and though more abundant in operations at ſome time than at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet it is alſo to help them in their weakneſſes and temptations, and through ſufferings, while they are yet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. But his perſonal coming which Believers wait for, is to free them from weakneſs, temptation, ſufferings, and mortality; and it is a perſonal, viſible, and bodily coming, as is foreſhewn; ſo, as the deceit of theſe is by it eaſily ſeen and avoided.</p>

                     <p>Thus will the knowledge of this Branch of the Teſtimony of Chriſt help us againſt all theſe, and ſuch-like deluſions, which withdraw from the Faith, and diſciple to Men, and make Schiſms and Rents from the true Church.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The knowledge, belief, and minding of the coming of Chriſt, as ſet forth in this Branch of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Chriſt, will help to preſerve and keep us from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into many miſcarriages, miſ-conceptions, and miſ-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of ſome Brethren; and alſo to afford help to ſuch of them, as do prefer the plain ſayings of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Notions of any other Man: as, to inſtance ſome of them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Such as deny any appearance of Chriſt in perſon on the Earth, till the laſt and final Judgement and ſentence, when all the wicked ſhall be caſt into the Lake of Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> True it is, he will be viſible on Earth, and on his Throne at that time: and true it is, That all the Juſt ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting Joy then alſo. And then Chriſt delivereth up the Kingdom to his Father, that God may be All in all: but then is no time for deſtroying all worldly powers, and for reſtoring all things, and for bringing the Creation into the Liberty of the Sons of God, and for the new Heaven and new Earth to be filled with Inhabitants, and for Chriſt to ſit on the Throne of <hi>David</hi> his Father, and for <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed to inherit the world; and for Chriſt and his Saints after his coming to rule over the Nations, or for the Nations to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:135210:107"/>ſerve them, and bring their Glory and Honour to the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this Life, the Saints according to their meaſure, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God through ſufferings; and in the new Heaven and new Earth, God both glorifieth his Saints, making them to raign; and they glorifie him by raigning: but in that laſt State, God only glorifies himſelf upon them, and in them, and through them, and them with himſelf. And why ſhould any of us ſo diſhonour God, as to deny the Truth, and true fulfilling of ſo many plain ſayings of Scripture, ſo oft af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, as hath been ſhewn, and will be more?</p>
                     <p>If any ſay, <hi>That we ſtick too much to the Letter of the Scripture in underſtanding thoſe places;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It might be anſwered, That in ſuch plain ſayings ſo often affirmed and bound with the Oath of God, and his Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Faithfulneſs of them, it is ſafer and better to ſtick cloſe to the Letter or VVords of Scripture, as they have been breathed forth by the Holy Spirit, than to make Unbelief of the Truth of thoſe plain ſayings, the Interpreter of their meaning, though with never ſo much humane VViſdom and Learning.</p>
                     <p>And it may be alſo anſwered, That ſo to underſtand thoſe ſayings, is according to the Rule commanded by God, and approved by all Believers, yea, and godly learned, as is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>But I farther anſwer,<note place="margin">Part 1. ch. 7.</note> That we are led by the Scripture thus to underſtand theſe things, both in that the things ſpoken of his firſt coming, in which many things had their ſpiritual ſenſe alſo, yet were all performed according to the plain expreſſion of the Letter: as, his being born of a Virgin in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> his being called a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> his riding on an Aſs, his being ſold for thirty pence, the banding of the Rulers and people againſt him, the ſcattering of his Diſciples, his Death, Burial, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion; his pouring forth the Holy Ghoſt, and ſitting on the right hand of God; all fulfilled to the utmoſt of the plain import of the Letter; and ſhall any thing be wanting in the ſecond coming of Chriſt? ſaith not the Angel, <hi>This ſame Ieſus ſhall ſo come, even as ye have ſeen him go?</hi> &amp;c. And alſo in that the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of theſe things, ſhews both a certain meaſure of fulfilling ſpiritually now,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:135210:108"/>and alſo a fulfilling according to the utmoſt of the Letter, which is alſo ſpiritual: but the one is inward, in the ſoul &amp; ſpirit; the other outward, on the Body alſo: &amp; of that inward in Soul and Spirit, he ſaith, <hi>We that believe, have a firſt fruits,</hi> (he ſaith not all, nor half, nor a tenth, but a firſt fruits) <hi>and that we wait for, is not only the whole or harveſt of this; but the adoption, even the redemption of the body, when alſo the whole Creation ſhall be reſtored into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God.</hi> And I might add the Apoſtles alluding to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. but enough is foreſaid for this. So that all our Brethren that heed and prize Scripture-Teſtimony, more than Traditions and Opinions of Men, will ſoon yield to believe this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such as believe and look for Chriſt his raigning in and over the VVorld in his Saints, and ſo would fight and ſtrive to ſet Chriſt on his Throne, and think all Adverſaries to Chriſt, that oppoſe them in his deſign to be before his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal appearing; Theſe Brethren ſeem to acknowledge this Truth, That Jeſus Chriſt will come and appear perſonally to raign on Earth, and that the Saints, that now ſuffer with him, ſhall raign with him in the Earth, and over the Nations, and that Chriſt ſhould now raign in his Saints: and both theſe are true; yea, without controverſie, Chriſt doth now raign in his Saints, and its deſired to be more and more: but yet his raigning in his Saints now, is neither his raigning over the VVorld, nor making his Saints to rule over the Men of the VVorld; and the miſtake is eaſily diſcernable to ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and minde the Scripture-Teſtimony of Chriſts coming to raign.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For Chriſt his now raigning in his Saints, is not his raigning <hi>by</hi> his Saints, or <hi>with</hi> his Saints, and they with him over Men; but as the expreſſion is, <hi>in</hi> his Saints; and that is, by his gracious Word and Spirit, ſubduing every thought to the obedience of Chriſt, and them to accept the croſs of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor</hi> 10.3, 4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.7-9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13, 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13-16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19-23.</note> and conformity to him in it: and ſo by the Spirit of Faith, Love and a ſound Minde, he dwells and lives in them, and they live to him; and yet in this VVorld are for his ſake, as he was, ſubject to humane Powers, and ſervants to all for their good: and though they overcome the VVorld, yet their Victory is by Faith, and not by carnal weapons, and

                  <p>Secondly, That the Sentence and Curſe did paſs on them after the Promiſe and Interpoſure of Chriſt the new publick Man, he having fore-accepted to be in that Nature, and under the Law under which they were fallen, that ſo he might come and bear that Sentence and Curſe for Mankinde, and ſo take the ſting and venome out of it, and in due ſeaſon bring them out: and this alſo was without difference, for the good of all Mankinde.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the promiſe in the Teſtimony and ſound,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:135210:116"/>lies as open and free for all Mankinde and every of them, as it did for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah,</hi> that they might believe, and in believing be the Seed of Chriſt, and Children of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Mother <hi>Evah,</hi> and ſo have the ſame hope.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That we may know, That as the Goſpel for the good of Mankinde, was firſt declared in denouncing the Curſe on the Serpent and his Seed: ſo all the Threats and Curſes denounced on the Enemies of Chriſt and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they are Fruits of God's Love, and ſure Promiſes to Believers. And this was the firſt Revelation given of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now alſo for Evidences and Demonſtrations of the Truth and Goodneſs hereof, beſides this revealed Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God, it is to be ſeen in his works of Creation and Providence:<note place="margin">

And ſo now, and from thence, <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his handy-work. Day unto day uttereth ſpeech,</hi> &amp;c. And by theſe works of Creation and Providence, God ſhineth forth, and manifeſteth to Men his Eternal Power &amp; Goodneſs, his Being or Godhead, his Wiſdom and Love to Mankinde: and theſe he hath divided to all Nations under the whole Heaven, to ſerve them for their good, and to ſuch a gracious end: and by theſe he gives hints of a Ranſome and Mediator between him and men; through whom, he that is holy and juſt is yet ſo merciful and gracious to ſinful and unworthy men, even that they might believe him to be, and to be merciful, and a Rewarder of them that ſeek him, and ſo repent, and come in to him; and ſo far, and in ſuch a ſenſe, the ſound of the Goſpel is preached in and by the Creation in the whole Earth, and ſo in and by every Creature under Heaven, to all Nations and every Man. And theſe two, the rumour of the Goſpel as declared in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and the Evidences of his Goodneſs in the works of Creation, were the two Mediums

                  <p>Yet God did even at the firſt, in this proviſion made in Chriſt, for Men, and for inſtructing them in this Revelation and theſe Evidences of him, he choſe in him certain Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whom he furniſhed above others with the Knowledge of the Goſpel, as ſo revealed, and alſo with Underſtanding of his Power, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Mercy and Minde, evidenced in his works, that they ſhould teach the ſame to others, to convert them to God.

Such Teachers then provided:</p>
                  <p>And yet this is not all, for God did endue theſe Teachers with his Spirit, and went forth with his Spirit in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,

And <hi>Sem</hi> lived five hundred and two yeers after the Flood; ſo that if he did not out-live <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet he was living on the Earth, when <hi>Abraham</hi> offered up <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Son; and he was a Prieſt and Teacher of God in the Church, and for, and to the whole World: I will not determine, That he was <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> that bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> though probabilities of it enough might be given: nor will I ſay any thing more of <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> and the reſt; but, That the Goſpel thus revealed and rumoured, and the Goodneſs of God in his workes of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thus evidenced, being thus taught by thoſe Elders that feared God, was, for the good of all Men, and ſaving to them, and ſuch as did receive the ſame, and abide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, were ſaved thereby, I ſuppoſe none queſtions.

                  <p>THeſe firſt VVitneſſes had alſo ſome other gifts that were for confirmation, which were chiefly to them, yet neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal to every one, nor peculiar to the firſt VVitneſſes, but pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the firſt age of the Church, the gifts mentioned that are for continuance, were to ſome more, to ſome leſs, yet to all ſome; and theſe were for edifying the body of Chriſt: but theſe other gifts are not perſonally to every Believer; and though they were given to the Church, yet their principal end was for unbelievers, That ſuch as had not heard, and been taught, and ſo did not know, That the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Saviour of the world was come, and had offered up the acceptable Sacrifice; and, that this very Jeſus was he; this Jeſus whom they preached is the Chriſt; and, that God will be worſhipped and approached to in and through him; and that ſuch as do believe in him, and approach to God by him, ſhall be ſaved. Till this was proclaimed, rumoured, and taught through the world, and had been ſufficiently confirmed for truth, ſo, as it was received and profeſſed by many witneſſes; ſignes and miracles were neceſſary, to convince the unbelievers of the truth of it, and to confirm the weak and unſtable in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the ſame. And indeed for theſe ends were ſuch ſigns, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and miracles granted to be done<note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20, 21, 22.</note>: and ſo it's evident ſuch

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 19.6.</note>: though many had the Gift of ſpeaking with Tongues, yet by any thing recorded, it's not like they received it, but in the Miniſtery of ſome of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; though the Holy Ghoſt, for comforting, renewing, and filling the Heart with joy and ſome ſpiritual Gifts, was given in the Miniſtery of the Goſpel by other Diſciples<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 8.39. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.17, 18, 19.</note>: yea, the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt in this ſort, is to all that God calls by the Goſpel, that in believing they may receive it<note n="h" place="margin">

And all the Miniſters God approveth and ſendeth forth to miniſter Goſpel to the World, they are brought up in, and ſent forth of this Univerſity, being Members thereof, as is proved in that already ſaid; and yet I would add one proof more, even from the Prayer of our Saviour for theſe, in <hi>John</hi> 17. where having prayed for the fitneſs, furniture and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the miniſtration of thoſe immediately called, choſen, taught and ſet forth by himſelf, he proceedeth in that Prayer, ſaying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, <hi>&amp; verſ.</hi> 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Neither do I pray for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word,</hi> (which is no other but his own word, he received of the Father, and gave to them:) and ſo it is through their Miniſtration of the word; and ſo the ſame word, and as miniſtred and recorded by theſe firſt VVitneſſes, who were immediately ſent forth by him, with this Miniſtration, for the Obedience of Faith among all Nations, and for all that believe through their word, He prayeth,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>That they all</hi> (he ſaith not ſome onely or the chief Officers they ſhall chuſe, but the unfeigned Believers, even they all) <hi>may be one, as thou Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi> VVhich cannot be meant of the Eſſence of God, becauſe he ſpeaketh of Miniſtration; nor is it meant onely of being one in him by the Spirit of Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on him, though this be included; yea, the union of the Father and Son in will for Miniſtration, and of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Son, and the Son in the Father, and ſo the union between them, is more then ſo; yea, I may ſay, there is ſuch an union between them, as is higher then we can conceive, and incommunicable alſo, though the benefit of it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable; but the union here meant, appears by that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, and this following, with the ſcope of the buſineſs, to be the union of the Spirit for Miniſtration, as the Father was and is one, and of one minde in Chriſt, that he ſhould make peace by his blood, and then preach peace, that Men might believe; and that in preaching peace, he ſhould ſpeak his
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:135210:164"/>words, that he gave him, and ſeek his ends for glorifying him, in diſplaying and extending Salvation to Men; and eternally ſaving believing Men. So Chriſt was one in and with the Father in all this: and in the ſame love with the ſame deſign, did both make peace by his Blood, and preach peace in the ſame words, and for the ſame end the Father gave them to him, and ſo are they one in the ſame love and deſign, for the good of Mankinde in this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of peace-preaching to bring Men in to believe, and to preſerve Believers to eternal Life. And now having committed the Miniſtry of Reconciliation by peace-preaching to his firſt VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and prayed for, and begun to frame them into union with him in this deſign, he prayeth therewith, for all that unfeignedly believe on him through their word, and ſo are united to him by Faith and Love, that they may be framed by the ſame Spirit of Faith to his minde, and ſo be one in the Father and him, in the ſame love and the ſame deſign, for carrying forth this Miniſtration as he did; and to the ſame ends, though through like ſufferings, as he did, and as the firſt VVitneſſes did, that ſo we may be one together with them, and all one in the Father and the Son in this love and deſign purſued in the ſame way for Miniſtration. And this to be the union meant, appears alſo in the next words, which are, <hi>That the world</hi> (that is, ſuch as yet believe not) <hi>may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that thou haſt ſent me:</hi> (which can be no leſs,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>And the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them,</hi> (which is not the glory he had with the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was, and with which he is now glorified at the Father's right hand, for that was not then as yet given to him, as he was Man, but to be given him on the finiſhing his whole work for ſuffering and overcoming death, and his own immediate perſonal Miniſtration and his Aſcenſion into Heaven, and offering up the acceptable ſacrifice, and then was that glory given him; ſo that of this glory he ſpeaketh not but of) the glory of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, given him immediately of the Father; which was a more great and glorious Miniſtration then ever before given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any of the Prieſts, or Prophets, or <hi>John Baptiſt:</hi> and ſo it's called the glorious Goſpel.

                  <p>FRom all that hath been ſaid in the ſecond and third Part of this Treatiſe, and the Scriptures alledged, and ſo in the whole Scripture-Teſtimony of Chriſt, it appears,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That there is one Faith, and but one Faith, that is, Faith indeed, real and true in its kinde; and ſo not divers kindes of Faith, each true in its kinde.

For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

And this is one.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Grace of Faith, or that believing in the Goſpel that is called Faith, it is that believing which is begot in the heart by the Diſcovery and Teſtimony,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Rom</hi> 3.25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.8, 9, 10.</note> the Spirit in the means he uſeth, hath given of Chriſt; in which a Man diſcerneth the Truth and Goodneſs teſtified, is perſwaded of it in his heart. And this is one, one way and manner of believing that Object of Faith; and from thence it is called Faith, and ſo truely ſtill one Faith, the Object diſcovered having drawn to it ſelf a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So when through the Operation of Grace believed, the Heart imbraceth the Object believed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10.</note> and ſo by Faith is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to it, in truſt and well-pleaſedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is ſtill but one and the ſame Faith, the ſame Object uniting to it ſelf: whence indeed it hath the name of Faith; ſo as ſtill Faith is one, and but one.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That as Faith is uſed for the prevalency of the Object of Faith, drawing the Hearer and Beholder to believe: and ſo for the Grace of Faith or Believing, though the Faith be one, yet there are divers Degrees in and of it, and divers Acts and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One Degree of Believing (which in reſpect of the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.42.</note> and which if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biden in it will unite to, may be called faith) is yet ſhort of a real new-birth: it is ſuch a belief of the Goſpel-Teſtimony, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to light ſeen, one believeth Jeſus to be the Chriſt, ſo far as to count his ſaying true; and yet not ſo overcome by that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, to ſee and acknowledge his own vileneſs, and the vanity of all his own beſt righteouſneſs, and his ſin in not ſooner believing by evidences foregiven, and ſo ſee not yet the fulneſs and liberty in Chriſt for them, and ſo are not by the knowledge of the Truth made ſingle to Chriſt: they are ſprinkled with water, and moved with Spirit, but not yet born of VVater and Spirit; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Righteouſneſs, but not yet with the heart unto Righteouſneſs: they are by the hearing of Faith ſo far born of God as to believe Jeſus to be the Chriſt, and confeſs him to be the Lord; but not ſo far born of God, as to be emptied of themſelves, and united to Chriſt, and ſo are not yet inwardly renewed and regenerated; and ſo though in the outward Court, not yet really tranſlated out of the Power of Darkneſs into the Kingdom of God's dear Son: and yet even theſe Believers, if they abide in this Faith of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Goſpel, and give heed to the plain ſayings thereof,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.30, 31.</note> and abide therein, they ſhall be ſaved, ſhall know the Truth, and the Truth will make them free. To ſay theſe did but pretend or ſeem and profeſs to believe, and ſo are ſaid to believe in reſpect of their ſeeming and proſeſſion to believe, in the judgement of Charity, is too much preſumption, and ſawcineſs, and derogation from the Holy Ghoſt; for the Evangeliſts writ this after Chriſt was aſcended, and they indued with the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo writ by his inſpiration; ſo that thoſe ſayings ſuch did believe, were not the ſayings of Men imperfect in knowledge, and judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgement of Charity by conjecture; but the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Holy Ghoſt that knoweth all things, the Spirit of Truth that cannot erre or be deceived. And he ſaith, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on his Name, they believed on him: and who will be ſo proud of his VViſdom and Knowledge, as to direct the Spirit of the Lord, and undertake to counſel him, and teach him to ſpeak more rightly and ſafely, and ſay, they ſeemed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, they profeſſed to believe; in the judgement of Charity they ought to be counted Believers, though in the iſſue it appears they did not believe? That which ſome bring to help this conceit,

                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.24, 25.</note> namely, that Chriſt did not commit himſelf to them, becauſe he knew all Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for it is not ſaid Jeſus knew they believed not,<note place="margin">

And ſo in the other place the Holy Ghoſt affirmeth, That as Chriſt ſpake, many believed on him:<note place="margin">

                  <p>GOd in theſe his Purpoſes concerning Jeſus Chriſt, and in his Election of him, hath purpoſed alſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mankinde for the honor of his Son: which Purpoſe, as ordered in his counſel, is not conceiveable and expreſſable for us, but in diſtinct and ſeveral parcels: and ſo in Scripture I finde,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Purpoſe of God to be, To give all Mankinde unto his Son Chriſt, to be his, and under his Dominion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="3">3.

This is verily the declared purpoſe of God, and it is ſure according to his minde and heart: and this appeareth in God's ſpeaking to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whoſe loyns, Chriſt, according to the fleſh, was, and forth of him to come: and to him God ſaid, <hi>Thou
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:135210:187"/>ſhalt be a bleſſing,</hi> or <hi>Be thou a bleſſing,</hi>

                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7, 8, 9</note> becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not on Chriſt: ſo as if they perſiſt in refuſing his words,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.48 <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16</note> and to believe in him, the word or Goſpel preached to them, ſhall judge them at the laſt day, when Chriſt will judge them according to the Goſpel, when he will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired in his Saints, that in this Day of Grace have believed the Teſtimony of him; and the reſt, that by the means he uſed,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9, 10.</note> have not known God in his gracious Minde, nor obeyed the Goſpel, ſhall periſh from his preſence.

Nor could I ever finde any, the acuteſt wits, that ever could either finde out ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes or expreſſions in the Scripture, importing a probability of it; nor can they tell the perſons who are under ſuch purpoſes: as for
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:135210:189"/>their term <hi>Elect,</hi> it hath been, and will again be fully ſhewn, how it's abuſed and wreſted to ſuch an end: yet of the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> under ſome conſideration, who, his purpoſe is, ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and who not, after Caution given, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew.</p>
                  <p>The Caution I deſire to be heeded is this,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> That for the Sons of Men, as that is true which is affirmed of them in the two publick Men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 18. and that by Chriſt, being made under the Law,<note place="margin">

But theſe come not in the number I am to ſpeak of, nor was any purpoſe againſt theſe. Let this be heeded.</p>
                  <p>Again, for the Sons of Men, as Men fallen and meerly natural, and come to the uſe of underſtanding; yet if no day of gracious viſitation hath paſſed on them, ſo as in ſome meaſure to open their eyes, and give them to diſcern, and move in their hearts towards convincement and turning: theſe are all yet in blindeneſs, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and under the power of ſin and Satan, corruption in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſts working in them; and ſo are blinde, deaf, dead, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Life of God in Chriſt, and ſo are unable to hear, ſee, underſtand and believe the Teſtimony of Chriſt; yea, all that come to the uſe of underſtanding, till by ſome light and power from God, they be ſo viſited as to be touched in heart, ſomewhat lighted and touched with ſome convincements in means uſed, are in this evil caſe, and none better then other in that reſpect. And theſe are not the objects or ſubjects of the purpoſes I have to
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:135210:189"/>ſpeak of; but as there is in the will and purpoſe of God, a Day or Dayes of Viſitation for all that are come to the uſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22.</note> eſpecially where the Goſpel comes and is preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, as it is among thoſe I can ſpeak or write to: So of ſuch as this Day of Viſitation hath paſſed upon, let me be underſtood; namely, of thoſe towards whom God in uſing means, doth in the means he uſeth, and by the light and power he therein extendeth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their ears to hear his voice, and enlightneth their minde to diſcern; ſo opening their eyes, to ſee in ſome meaſure what is preſented to and required of them; and moveth in their hearts by his word ſounded, and grace preſented, that they might in ſeeing ſee, in hearing hear, and ſo underſtand, and turn towards him; and ſo he would heal them. In all which, there is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs in one more then in another; yea, they that in ſeeing ſee, have nothing to glory in, but the Riches of his Grace, in giving them ſuch an eye, and alluring them with ſuch an object, in ſeeing to ſee, and extending ſo freely following Grace to heal them. But they that in ſeeing ſee not, when an eye is given them, and ſuch an object preſented to their view; but for the love of any other thing, diſlike the light, and ſo cloſe their eys, ſtop their ears, and harden their hearts, have therein willingly made themſelves much worſe then either themſelves or their Fellows fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, and this not through any want on the part of God or Chriſt, but meerly through wilfulneſs in themſelves, and ſiding with the Tempter. And of Men thus viſited, and under this conſideration, I am now to ſpeak: and ſo in the Scripture I finde.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

And theſe, and ſuch as theſe, even for this cauſe, were appointed to farther ſtumbling, and ſo cannot believe; yea, this is held forth cleerly to us alſo, in many other places of Scripture, all ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Language, as alſo in that example forementioned, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.28, 30, 41, 42, 60, 66. So that concerning the Purpoſe of God, who ſhall be helped to believe, and who not; we have it cleer from Jeſus Chriſt by his Spirit in the Prophets and in the Apoſtles, and in his own perſonal ſayings, to be men under ſuch conſiderations: and it becomes us to deſire no other knowledge of this. And to this alſo very well agreeth that which is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will be hardneth.</hi> For God hath not left us in the dark, nor ſpoken as a Barbarian to us; ſo as none can know by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will on whom he will have mercy, or whom he will har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: but hath made known his minde, that as he firſt ſheweth

                  <p>And thus the Purpoſes of God concerning Mankinde as revealed in Scripture, are verily ſuch as is ſaid; and in this written of them in theſe four Branches of his Purpoſe, compared with that ſaid in the ſecond Chapter of this fourth part, in the Cautions there given.

                  <p>BY <hi>Believers</hi> I mean not ſuch as onely feign, pretend and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves to believe, and do not; nor doth the Scripture anywhere call any upon that account Believers but Hypocrites. But as in Scripture-account, ſo by Believers I mean, ſuch as do indeed in ſome meaſure believe the word or Teſtimony of Chriſt; and ſo, though that Teſtimony be but one, and Faith one, and but one true believing; yet of thoſe that do indeed believe the ſame Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, confeſs the ſame Faith, I finde two ſorts of Believers, as is before ſhewn at large.</p>

                  <p>Yet ſtill agreeing with the ſame, the ſenſe is more plainly opened in the words, thoſe three things in them propounded conſidered with this premiſe, That the whole ſentence be taken according to its own import of two things performed in it, that is to ſay, firſt, as a Deſcription of the predeſtinate, with that whereto they are predeſtinate, and for what end: ſecondly, a propounding of examples to them, of ſuch Saints as have gone before and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their courſe; and ſo according to both theſe, let the words be minded.</p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:135210:201"/>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſhall conſider thoſe three things as the Deſcription of the Predeſtination.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who they are that God hath thus predeſtinated? enough is ſaid already to ſhew they are not any of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sons as fallen in him, and naturally come forth from him, as ſo remaining, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: but only ſuch as are foreknown &amp; fore-owned of God, which are onely the Called according to purpoſe,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.3 <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6, 9 <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16 <hi>Act.</hi> 9.15, 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.41, 42. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11, 12 <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.7</note> that through the grace and love of God in Chriſt believed, do love God: all theſe, and none but theſe, are known of God: theſe all, and onely theſe elect, owned and approved: God doth, having firſt or fore-owned them in that very election and owning of them, appoint, ordain and predeſtinate them to this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That is both intimately hinted what not to, or expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to what intimately ſhewed; that it is not to make propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſins, and to offer the acceptable ſacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to purpoſe Chriſt onely was to do and hath done that, and God hath commended his love to Man-ward through him: nor is it to be called as ſinners to repentance, and to believe in Chriſt; and in believing to receive remiſſion of ſins paſt, and ſo to be framed to love God, and by Faith to be the Sons of God, and in that Faith in him, to have the beginnings of eternal life; All which in ſome good meaſure they haye already, being Lovers of God, and called according to purpoſe, and ſo known and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God before this predeſtinating them: but that which they as Sons are predeſtinated unto, is ſomething in which Chriſt as the prime Son is ſet forth as a pattern to them; and ſo it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, They are predeſtinated to be conformed to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his Son; which muſt needs be, to that likeneſs of him in which he is ſet before us for a pattern and example to conform to; and that may be comprehended in theſe three Branches, as the Scripture plentifully and plainly ſhews.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Let all theſe things in the words be conſidered as the Apoſtle here propoſeth to the Believers, according to his wonted manner, the examples of ſuch as had gone before them in the Faith, to comfort and encourage them to ſervice and ſuffering, and through ſufferings to wait for glory: in which examples he alſo ſets forth Chriſt as the chief, to behold and conform to: they when choſen were predeſtinated, and then called to it and alſo juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and glorified; and there is no change in God; we may be ſure, believing in him,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16</note> he will even ſo deal in the ſame manner with us; they are patterns for us that believe.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Owen:</hi> and I ſhall deſire to acknowledge all the Truth I can finde in his Sayings, and by Scripture to remove the reſt. He ſaith, <hi>God's Eternal Purpoſe of ſaving ſome in and by the Mediation of Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Saving ſome,</hi> he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not what ſome, or of what kinde the ſome is: if it be meant of his fallen Creatures, it's acknowledged ſo far true; for both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Mankinde was fallen, and he purpoſed no way of ſaving for the fallen Angels: there is no conteſt about that: but if by ſome be meant ſome of Mankinde, and no way to diſcriminate them, that it may be known who, then is there no door to life o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for any man to come in at; nor Goſpel that can be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Truth to and for them while unbelievers, to bring them in to believe. If any conceit it is ſome elect Ones, that cannot be; for it is meant of all them, no gainſaying. But his Expreſſions elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhew it to be meant of Mankinde, <hi>Some of them:</hi> for as for any elect in Chriſt before <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, to be fallen in his fall, is but a humane device and tradition, nothing in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Chriſt for it, but all againſt it; or, That there are any elect Ones in Chriſt, that according as they are elected, are not alſo begun to be ſaved, and ſo far holy and beloved, is another hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane device and tradition, without, and beſide, and contrary to the Scripture, as hath been plainly ſhewn. So that of neceſſity by the word <hi>ſome,</hi> (as by other Expreſſions he would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) is meant ſome of all Mankinde fallen: but then what ſome ſhall we conceive? for all Mankinde were once made righteous, and ſo beheld and loved in one publick Man, who was both Male and Female; ſo that all Mankinde was alike righteous, and alike loved as righteous, in this one publick Man then: but this firſt publick Man, both Male and Female ſinned, and ſo fell under ſin and death and all Mankinde in him, and muſt needs have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in that ſin and death they were fallen under, if God had not provided a Saviour to interpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Now was not all Mankinde, alike fallen, alike viewed, and alike under the ſame danger; or were there any more individuals come forth to make a ſome of; or had any, any other wayes ſinned and fallen under ſin and death then in this publick Man? and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:135210:205"/>what then ſhall the ſome be? the Male or the Female the Soul or the Body, or ſome part of either? Such whimſies are in the dreams of ſome; but ſure we are far from them: I wiſh we may uſe no Expreſſions to ſtrengthen them. But then, did not God finde out a Mediator for the firſt publick Man, whole <hi>Adam</hi> as fallen, to take away ſin, deſtroy death, and the works of the Devil, which was already entred into the world? and did not this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor interpoſe and undertake in that very moment of the Fall, to be a ſecond publick Man, to take the Nature, the Place, the Cauſe of the firſt publick Man in hand, to work a reſtauration for him and ſo for all that were in him, and naturally to come forth from him, even all Mankinde? where then ſhall we finde the ſome of them? if there were any left out for whom there was no purpoſe of God for any ſaving them in and by the Mediation of Chriſt, why do they not periſh in that firſt death denounced? why are they not at laſt judged, according to that Law under which they fell in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?</hi> why do they not in dying die, ſo as to have every thing filling them with horror and torment, till they periſh for ever in the firſt death in the utmoſt of it? How comes Mercy, Patience, and Means to lead to Repentance, to be extended to them, if no ranſome hath been given for them, God being not onely merciful but righteous in all his wayes? if Chriſt did not die, and give himſelf a ranſome for them; if he have wrought no Salvation for them, and ſo have none to beſtow on them, how is he become their Lord? Why is the Goſpel to be preached to them? why are their ſins aggravated by the means he uſeth towards them? and how ſhall they be ſaid to reward him hatred for love, and be judged by him according to the Goſpel, and ſentenced unto a ſecond death, which if he had not come and uſed means towards them and they rebelled againſt him, they could never have been? or did God firſt purpoſe in and through Chriſt, this ſecond death to them that were already under the firſt death, and no Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption wrought for them; and ſo ſend Chriſt into the world to be an Abaddon or Man-Deſtroyer, to condemn ſo great a part of Mankinde farther then they were condemned in <hi>Adam?</hi> I will proceed no further in this.</p>
                  <p>The Goſpel and the Purpoſes of God, as by his word and works declared, and as ſet forth in this Treatiſe tells us another ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which takes away all theſe abſurdities brought in by this <hi>ſome:</hi>
                     <pb n="375" facs="tcp:135210:205"/>and yet neither does he expreſs it of what ſaving he means, whether of that Salvation of the Nature of Man wrought in himſelf as the publick Man, for Men, all Men, or of that Salvation upon the account of the former extended to Men to ſave them, or of the efficacy of the firſt in the extention of the ſecond, on the ſame account in Believers and Receivers, which is opened in the Goſpel, and expreſt according to it in this Treatiſe; but ſome Expreſſions elſewhere uſed, imply to mean it of all: ſo that this term <hi>ſome,</hi> is not rightly uſed.</p>
                  <p>Yet this is true, That he ſaith God's Purpoſe of ſaving was in and by the Mediation of Chriſt; yea, his ſaving in every reſpect, onely this glory to God in Chriſt, that he is the firſt purpoſed and firſt elected, and all following Purpoſe of Salvation is in and by him. And ſo this alſo, That the coming of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Salvation wrought by him, and Preparation made in him, is a Fruit of the Love, Will and Purpoſe of God, is true: and the extending of this Salvation in any or all the Fruits thereof, to Men, and the Efficacies thereof, in Men, are the Fruits of the Mediation of Chriſt, and ſo of the ſame Will and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God in and through the Mediation of Chriſt: this is true alſo.</p>
                  <p>But that this act of his Will, (whether he mean it of his Purpoſe of preparing Salvation for Men in Chriſt, or of extending Salvation to Men through the Mediation of Chriſt, or of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of this Salvation in Believers; for he leaves this in the dark) That the Scripture knows it by no other Name, then that of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, Adoption, or the Purpoſe of God according to Election, or the Purpoſe of his Will in Jeſus Chriſt, is a dark ſaying and full of confuſion, and intimately untrue, unleſs he deny it to be called by all theſe Names; and then there is ſubtilty, and room left for evaſion in the Expreſſion. Let it be conſidered, The Will of God in his Purpoſe is in it ſelf an act, ſure one ſingle real act, before any accompliſhment come forth: and if he mean of that, it will not reach ſome of the other terms; and if he mean of that act which is outward toward the Creature, which is confeſt the act of his Will, and alwayes ſuitable and according to his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; he ſaith not of which he meaneth: but take it for either or for both; yet there is confuſion in his ſaying, as if there were no diſtinction between Election and Adoption, and the Purpoſe of
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:135210:206"/>God according to Election, and the Purpoſe of his Will in Chriſt; and that all or any of theſe were and are equally and alike, the Name of this Purpoſe of his Will, in his Purpoſe of ſaving Men, in and by the Mediation of Chriſt. True it is, It may and doth bear the Name of the Purpoſe of his Will in Chriſt: and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture will bear it out to be known by that Name; the Eternal Purpoſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1.9, 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</note> which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus, which he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in himſelf, the Purpoſe of him that worketh all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſel of his own will; yea, it is called, The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, (preached by Chriſt, and to be preached by his Servants;) yea, and for the good Will of God and Grace given us in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, it is called, His own Purpoſe and Grace given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the World began. And if Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> had but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Purpoſe of electing and adopting in and by Chriſt, and his Purpoſe, that all ſhould take place according to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Grace, the Scripture would have borne it out. But for Election without diſtinction, to be that Purpoſe, or the Name of that Purpoſe, or that act of his Will, that is called his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſaving fallen Mankinde by the Mediation of Chriſt, no one place of Scripture ſaith, it ſpeaking of the Oracles and Works of God in this buſineſs,<note place="margin">

Oh the depth of the Riches, <hi>&amp;c!</hi> Gentiles once ſhut up under unbelief and now Jews, and yet his end in all this. That he might have mercy on all. See through the Chapter how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath opened Election, which as it ſtands firm with the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of God expreſt in Scripture, ſo it gives good ground to love and pity all Men, to pray for them, and uſe means for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; which the Purpoſe as expreſs'd by Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding Purpoſe with Election as undiſtinct, overturneth. And as for Adoption, I marvel that term ſhould be brought as the Name of the Purpoſe firſt mentioned: as for Election, I conceive there are none elected, but they are in electing, as much adopted as elected: for though Man may in his thoughts chuſe and elect one to be his Son and Heir, whom he may yet not ſo adopt and make his Son and Heir, according to his firſt thoughts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.2, 3.</note> as it fell out with <hi>Abraham;</hi> yet is it not ſo with God, for any that receive his electing Grace: and yet there may be a diſtinction between ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and choiſe of one to Sonſhip and Adoption, in this free and electing Grace making one a Son. But theſe run ſo together, I deſire no farther to ſearch into the diſtinction: but this I finde in Scripture, and believe, That God hath but one natural Son that is, his onely and firſt-begotten Son, even the Word, that was made fleſh, and ſo the Nature of Man taken by him into perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:135210:208"/>Union, is by the Grace of perſonal Union the ſame Son of God:<note place="margin">

And this I alſo finde, That the means appointed of God in his VVord for Diſpenſation and receiving the Grace of Adopition, is even therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Adoption,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.4, 5.</note> and ſo the Adoption was ſaid to pertain to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> while the VVord and Oracles was with them; and thoſe predeſtinated to the Miniſtration of Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, are ſaid to be predeſtinated to the Adoption of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by Jeſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">

                  <p>More might, but more need not be ſaid to cleer this, That though both Election and Adoption be things purpoſed of God in Chriſt, yet they are diſtinct in the counſel of his will; and though wrought according to his Purpoſe, yet they bear not the Name of the Purpoſe, but of things wrought according to his Purpoſe in the counſel of his VVill. So that this Deſcription of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God by Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> is not right, nor according to the approved Rule confeſt by himſelf,<note place="margin">See par. 1. c. 7.</note> being not Scripture-like, and ſo not fit to build any Opinion on, as thoſe in Scripture ſet forth are: but enough of this.</p>
                  <p>Yet before I leave it, it is needful to remove two miſtakes of many about the Purpoſe of God; the one is the making the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Salvation or Election the Foundation to build Believers on: the other is the making that the Purpoſe of God, which is no Purpoſe of his at all.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

Suppoſe ſome honeſt and learned Jew, before Chriſt came in the Fleſh, ſhould have affirmed God's Purpoſe of ſending forth his Son Chriſt to die, and riſe, and offer the acceptable Sacrifice; and ſo to be the Saviour of the World, that whoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting Life: Suppoſe, I ſay, he ſhould have taught this Purpoſe of God to be the Foundation; he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing miſcarried in Expreſſion: for the Foundation purpoſed and promiſed, was the Seed of the Woman to break the Serpent's Head, the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whom is bleſſing for all Nations, a Man to be the Rock and God's Salvation to the ends of the Earth; and though he was not then come forth, and ſo not laid, as now he is, yet he was held forth, though afar off, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to be looked to: and by reaſon of the agreement between the Father and him, and in his undertaking he was ſo vertuous and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, that he was a ſure Foundation; ſo as in beholding him, and reſting on him as yet to come,<note place="margin">

So that here were a little miſtake in this honeſt Jews Expreſſion; yet this miſtake might have been tolerable, becauſe the Foundation was as then no farther laid, but as held forth in the Promiſe and Revelation of the Purpoſe of God.

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>SOme have conceived, and are ready to affirm this for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, namely, That from Eternity before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World, God did decree and purpoſe eternall to ſave a certain number of perſons of fallen Mankinde, and eternally to damne all the reſt of Mankinde: and in this Purpoſe to elect as a peculiar people to himſelf, all, and onely thoſe he ſo purpoſed to ſave; and to reprobate all the reſt. And alſo, That in this Purpoſe he purpoſed to give his own Son, to take Man's Nature, therein to die, and riſe, and offer Sacrifice for all theſe elect, and no other; and to purchaſe for them Repentance, Faith, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and for no other: ſo that theſe elect ſhall infallibly have it all, and none but they. And, That the reſidue of Men, by the Soveraignty and Power of God, ſhall have their lives given them, and preſerved for a time; that living, they may by ſin deſerve this Damnation they were fore-purpoſed and ordained to, before it be executed; that ſo, whatever the Purpoſe was, the Execution may be juſt; yea, Goſpel preached to many of them, and ſome lower works of the Spirit vouchſafed them; yea, Faith attained by many of them, and holineſs true in its kinde; yea, profeſſion and doing worthily: from which if they fall, the greater their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; if they abide and die in that Faith, yet they muſt be damned: the Death of Chriſt and his Goſpel, and all means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to call and lead them to Repentance and Faith, had nothing really in Truth for their Salvation; but to leave them without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and aggravate their condemnation. All belonging to eternal Salvation, is onely for thoſe Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> that were eternally
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:135210:218"/>purpoſed and elected to be eternally ſaved; and in that Purpoſe Chriſt given to die for them, that they might be ſaved through him. And this eternal Purpoſe of God, ſome make the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on which, whoſoever is built, ſhall not miſcarry: and no right faith but that which ſprings from this eternal Purpoſe, and that is alſo built on it.</p>
                  <p>This framed Purpoſe affirmed both to be the eternal Purpoſe of God, and the foundation firſt laid, for ſuch as ſhall be ſaved to be built on, is an inhumane device, and a very fable, having no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to expreſs it; yea, it is a Wolf barking againſt the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Goſpel; and yet ſo of many will not be owned, till ſome better coat be put upon it. But if any can clothe it with, and make it bear the Name of Election and Reprobation, uſed in the Scripture, and cover it with a pretence to glorifie the Soveraignty, Omniſciency and Immutability of God, and of abaſing Man and magnifying Grace; if by Wit, Eloquence, and Rhetorick, and wreſting Scripture, it be covered with theſe pretences, it may be entertained as a Truth, and a harmleſs Lamb, by ſome zealous, humble, and learned Men; and ſo it may come to be depoſited into the keeping of ſome Graduates in ſome Univerſity, that can charm its voice, ſtop its violence in devouring, and ſet it forth in more orderly form; ſo that though the thing it ſelf be a Wolf; yet it having on it a Sheep's-Skin; and being charmed from its barking and violence of devouring; demeaning it ſelf, as by Art it hath been taught: It may ſo long go for a Sheep, and be cheriſhed in the Boſomes, and commended in the Declarations of wiſe, learned and godly Men; and be entertained, applauded, and pleaded for as a Sheep, by many zealous, conſcientious Profeſſors, and have certain brands of antiquity, and conſent of many learned and godly put upon it; and they that ſo do, till the Sheep's-Skin be taken off it, may remain godly ſtill, and yet much hurt be done: for the Wolf, as it groweth up, cannot but ſometime ſhew its Nature; yet ſubtilly: ſo, as if he bark, it is ſo out of the hearing of the judicious, that it will be denied to be he that did it: and if he devour any Sheep, it is ſo ſecretly in the Night, that when Light comes he is gone, and in another place; and ſo not known till by the Watchers he be ſpied among ſome of his Fellows, and heard barking, and ſeen devouring; and yet though they declare it, it will be hard to convince many of it, till themſelves
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:135210:218"/>be bitten, he hath been ſo long taken and applauded for a Sheep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
                  <p>And yet that this Wolf may be known to be ſo, even while the Sheep's-Skin is on him; if we, as we are taught,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1.</note> take Doctrines or Spirits that are falſe, in the ſame ſenſe with falſe Prophets, we have a good direction given us by our Saviour Chriſt, that ſaith,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruits.</hi> Now then, they being not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and profeſſed Wolves, but appearing in Sheep's-clothing,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 20.29.30.</note> and inwardly Wolves; and in Society not with the Wolves of the VVorld, but among the Sheep in the profeſt Church, what can fruits be to know them by? but onely theſe, that in ſtead of bleating like a Sheep, they bark; and inſtead of feeding with the Sheep, they are biting, if not devouring.</p>
                  <p>Now then confider this Doctrine, or deviſed Fable of ſuch a Purpoſe as laſt related and held forth for the Foundation of God's unchangeable Purpoſe and Election; of which, and no other, I now ſpeak: That it is a deviſed Fable, ſuch as the Apoſtles ſhunned,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20.</note> and charged others ſo to do, is evident; becauſe there is no one ſaying, nor divers, to be coupled in the Law and Teſtimony, in its own plainneſs and ſimplicity, to affirm it with: That it is a Wolf, the general Affirmation of our true Prophet and Shepherd aſſures us, that ſaith, <hi>All that ever came before me, are thieves and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>

He, The firſt purpoſed, The firſt promiſed; <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; yea, the whole Scripture teſtifies of him; yea, they all in thoſe times directed to look to him, as then to come, that Men might receive the knowledg of God's Minde, and behold his grace, and receive his Salvation, in minding and believing on him, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to be laid in <hi>Sion:</hi> and though the Purpoſe and Promiſe was plainly declared; yet not before, nor farther, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then he was declared; nor did it come forth till he came, nor did any of the Servants of God teach any to judge it come, till he came; but in his coming, it did come forth into act: and he is now laid in <hi>Sion,</hi> and held forth by <hi>Sion,</hi> and by the Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles plainly declared to be, The onely true Prophet, Rabbi,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:135210:219"/>Teacher, Shepherd, and Foundation: therefore whatever Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or Election be feigned to be before him, and ſo to be the foundation to be known and built upon, for comfort, or hope, or aſſurance of our intereſt in him and Salvation through him; and ſo before faith in him; or any otherwiſe known, then in knowing him, or any other then is firſt compleat in him and flowing through him: ſo as he himſelf, as diſcovered in the Goſpel, be the firſt Opener of the Father's Minde, Allurer of, and Peace-ſpeaker to the Heart, and Door of approach to God, and all ſaving Truth, and into fellowſhip with the Church; that ſame, that is not thus, is a Thief, and a Robber; yea, his being laid, called, and ſealed: for the foundation doth plainly demonſtrate this; for the foundation is that which is firſt brought forth to view, and ſo firſt ſaid; and then all that is to be built, laid on that foundation: and then the foundation beareth and upholdeth all the building. And Chriſt being affirmed to be this foundation; yea he onely, and no other: therefore, though the revealed Purpoſe of God concerning him, and of ſaving and communicating all ſaving-Grace, with and through him; and his ſealing-Approbation and Election of him for all this, and of all for his that are brought in to and upon him, be known in knowing him, and then and ſo heavenly cords to draw upon, and unite and faſten more to him; yet they are by good Men very improperly called the Foundation, which Chriſt himſelf onely is; as is foreſhewn.</p>
                  <p>But for this foreſaid deviſed Purpoſe and Election of a certain number of fallen Mankinde to eternal ſalvation, and of Chriſt to be given to die onely for them, to purchaſe it for them onely, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is not onely a fable, but a Thief and Devourer, and ſo a Wolf, and being grown, and often with his fellows, his fruits do now diſcover him, both in his barking and devouring; yea, even while ſome plead for him: for it barks and ſnaps directly againſt the Purpoſe of God, ſet forth by our Saviour<note n="a" place="margin">

No ſure; he meant but ſome, an unknown elect Company, that may be ſome of all ſorts of Men: and to maintain this device, it leads to change the words and terms of Scripture, and for <hi>all Men,</hi> and <hi>the World,</hi> to ſay <hi>ſome of all ſorts;</hi> and for <hi>all, every,</hi> and <hi>the World,</hi> to ſay <hi>of the Elect;</hi> and call the Seal, the foundation; as more ſafe terms then the Holy Ghoſt uſeth (for his terms confute the fable) and it perverts and changes the ſayings of Chriſt, and to that end brings in Philoſophy, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies Queſtions and ſtrife about words, to the ſubverting many, I charge in this, and that which follows, nothing but the fable it ſelf; no Man, unleſs he willingly and profeſſedly make himſelf guilty.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all the miſchief this fable doth, as many that are delivered out of it, can tell; for this fable and VVolf, being imbraced and taken for Truth, or a Sheep, and ſo admired, it robbeth and devoureth many wayes: as to ſay, ſome that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly touched and conſciencious, fearful to deceive themſelves, or be deceived, having nothing demonſtrated to them, that can truly ſatisfie them, that they are of this elect number, are by the thoughts of it driven into a terrible and ungoſpel-like deſpair, and from thence to hard thoughts of God; yea, neer, if not to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy of him, for making <hi>Adam,</hi> and giving him ſuch a Law, ſuffering him to fall, and retaining in himſelf that Purpoſe to damne the moſt of men unavoidably, without leaving them any means of eſcape: and then to wiſh, Oh that there were no God, no Law, no Heaven, no Hell, or that God had never given us being. And all the comfort this fable will afford them, is but this, They may be elected for any thing they know (though ten to one it is not ſo) they may be of this ſmalleſt number; and they muſt ſubmit to the will of God, to be damned if he have ſo purpoſed:
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:135210:220"/>for he will bring them he ſaveth, to this ſubmiſſion; and if they ſubmit to this, there is hope they are of the elect number. Oh! how hardly can they do this? and how dreadful are their thoughts? and yet ſo gracious is God, that he affords ſome hints of Mercy to them in the thoughts of Chriſt his dying for ſinners, and coming to ſave ſinners; ſo that whoever believe on him, ſhall not periſh but have everlaſting life: and here their drooping Spirits begin to revive.</p>
                  <p>But then comes this fable again and tells them, 'Tis true indeed Chriſt died for ſinners, but not for all ſinners, but onely for ſuch ſinners, as were elect from eternity; and unleſs they be of that number, the Death of Chriſt, and all Faith in him they can attain to, ſhall do them no good. And the poor Soul hearkning to this, is diſtracted and eaſt down again, and begins to think it muſt yield to be willing to be damned: and they that cannot flatter themſelves with conceit of ſuch a willingneſs, whither if the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy of God prevent not, it will lead, and whither it hath led ſome, hath been ſadly known.

                  <p>But this fable not being yet baniſhed, doth ſecretly ſuggeſt, All this is true indeed; but yet this Death of Chriſt for ſinners, as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and all this free and rich Grace in and through him, is not, nor never was intended for all ſinners, but onely to ſome of them before the World was: the Elect, and they onely, and no other ſhall have it.</p>
                  <p>And for the reverence ſo of many holy Men as have affirmed
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:135210:221"/>this fable for Truth, this Suggeſtion is received: and ſo in ſtead of believing what Grace tendereth. they are perſwaded firſt to wait for ſome ſpecial and perſonal Manifeſtation of their Election from eternity, by ſome ſupernatural ſhine, and powerful dictate in ſome ſpeaking to their heart, that they are elect ſons, and ſo that Chriſt hath died for them, and their ſins are forgiven: and for want of this, many long languiſh, and refuſe to believe, and to be comforted by the Words of the Goſpel; and ſome over-haſty of Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſnatch at any word that cometh ſuddenly into their thoughts, though left to their own and others Interpretation, yet putt up with, and boaſt of them: ſome in this waiting, ready to receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Satanical</hi> deluſion, coming as an Angel of Light, and ſo to be tranſported with ſtrange dreams and erring fancies; yet ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful is God, that to ſome thus waiting; he not laying this their folly to their charge, doth for his own Name ſake in Chriſt, in ſome ſeaſon, minde them of his graciouſneſs and love in Chriſt, with ſome ſaying or promiſe in the Goſpel put to their heart, in which they are drawn through Chriſt to behold him as a Father: and ſo for the preſent, ſweetly comforted and framed, yet the Dreams of the old fable not baniſhed. Anon after, ſome grow proud of their viſits, and though foiled with ſome paſſions and luſts, yet preſumptuouſly confident in their viſits, They ſay, They cannot by theſe things miſcarry; God can as ſoon ceaſe to be God, as ceaſe eternally to ſave them, becauſe of his eternal Purpoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them: yet others in minding the great and free love and goodneſs of God in Chriſt, and their own infirmities, are kept more humbly confident in his grace in Chriſt, and ſtirred up more ſeriouſly to acknowledge the failings that appear; and to ſeek in exerciſe of faith and uſe of means, help, preſervation, and encreaſe of grace through Chriſt; yet the relicks of the old fable hinders the free ſtream of their Love to ſuch as are yet in ignorance, and their ready declaring Goſpel to them, and apts them to many lofty Speeches, and un-Goſpel-like ſayings; and to judge all that by temptation are turned aſide, to have been but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites before; and to put a ſtop to weak Brethrens conſolation, that have not had their viſits. Yet God being gracious to both theſe ſorts, doth yet farther correct and teach them, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the force the old fable hath with them ſtill) and keeps their hearts to himſelf, and out of ſome backſlidings doth recal
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:135210:221"/>them, and heal them: his mercies are greater, and his waves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Mans, as many of us have cauſe to confeſs; for by his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious teachings, the Goſpel often breathing and ſhining upon their hearts, (notwithſtanding all the miſcarriages before ſaid) The Teſtimony of Jeſus; That he died for all, and is the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole VVorld; That whoever of them believe in him, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting Life: and this the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God is diſcerned and believed. And ſo the old fable it ſelf departeth, and they are more freely and ſweetly drawn upon Jeſus Chriſt, and have all their reſt and joy in him, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the grace of God in him, and to minde Purpoſe and Election, as it is, and appears in and through him, and ſo begin to be united to him, and in ſome meaſure conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, loving delightfully their brethren, and with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion thoſe that are yet in ignorance and unbelief, and readily holding forth the word of Life, as a word of Truth and Verity to them.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithſtanding all this, though the old fable be gone, ſome of the dregs of it are left remaining, ſecretly moving in them, which they in their fancy are rectifying to a new mould, as if though ſecret, yet ſome ſuch Election there is. But God hath purpoſed, and according to his Purpoſe, ſent Chriſt the Saviour of the World: and he hath purpoſed, and according to his Purpoſe, hath, doth and will uſe means towards all, that they might be ſaved, and eſpecially where the Goſpel comes; yea, ſo far ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his hand in the means, with ſuch ſufficiency of light and ſtrength, that they might indeed repent and believe; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and believing, he will ſurely ſave them by Chriſt: and if they in ſuch ſeaſons do not repent and believe, it is their own fault, and they loſe their own Souls: all which is verily true. But then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, If God ſhould do no more but that which is enough and ſufficient to bring Men in to believe, then would none believe, and ſo none would come into his reſt, and be eternally ſaved: but ſome muſt enter; therefore he hath decreed and purpoſed to overcome ſome with an almighty and unreſiſtable power: and thoſe onely ſo purpoſed, and ſo overcome, ſhall be eternally ſaved.</p>
                  <p>This at firſt bluſh would ſeem to ſet forth God's Mercy to all Mankinde, to free him from all the imputation of hardneſs and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:135210:222"/>cruelty by the former fable laid upon him to abaſe Man, and magnifie the riches and freeneſs of his Grace to ſome, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his Juſtice to others; and leaves room to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel as Truth to all, which the other fable did not: yet in Truth well weighed, it is found but a meer Artifice of remaining dregs of the former; and if long remaining, will have its barking, bleat, and bring forth many of its Fruits: and now it may be more marvelled, that the former fable gone, this ſhould be framed out of its dregs, after plain Goſpel-Teſtimony is believed, there being no one Saying in the Goſpel, declaring any ſuch thing, or that giveth ground for any ſuch conſequence: and why ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us that have received ſo much good in the Goſpel-Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſtrain for a conſequence to maintain that which the Goſpel declareth not; yea, which ſtands croſs to many Declarations; yea,<note place="margin">

Methinks none ſhould be ſo void of fear, to affirm, that as the Saying of the Holy Ghoſt, which is given as the ſuggeſtion of an evil ſpirit, &amp; Saying of a vain Man, and ſo reproved, Who hath reſiſted his Will? as if none had or could; which with grief, I ſuppoſe true Believers will confeſs they have too often. What other evils of diſſention among Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the affirming of this deviſed Purpoſe to be both the Purpoſe of God, and the Foundation, and what other inconveniencies follow the maintaining of the laſt mentioned figment, I will forbear to ſpeak; onely I confeſs, for the reverence I bare to ſome, I was a long time ſnared with this old fable, till I experimented the evils mentioned, and was brought to confeſs God in his Sayings true, whoever be a lyar: nor do I now blame any but my ſelf, who might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived good onely, and not harm by what I read, if I had not made Mens holineſs and learning, but the Scripture onely the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of my Faith; and yet I have learned this, That a Wolf in a Sheep's-Skin may for a time be imbraced, and pleaded for by them that are no Wolves; and ſo to be ſober in judging: yea, this I farther confeſs, That when I thought my ſelf freed, this laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned figment did a long time remain with me, yea, I was not freed of it, when that my firſt publiſhed Tract called by the Printer,

So that Chriſt is come is the fleſh, the promiſed Seed in which is bleſſing for all Nations, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. the immortal Seed, of which all that are born from above, have their conception and birth; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any other Seed, nor any that can be counted his Seed, till by the Grace diſcovered in theſe Promiſes fulfilled, they be brought in to him, and ſo born again; and ſo any Man in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, may come to be of this Seed: and in this diſcovery of him, as theſe promiſes are fulfilled in him, wonderfully is the Love of God to Mankinde holden forth and diſplayed, that Men might believe; as is ſhewn in the Teſtimony of Chriſt, and in the laſt Revelation of him, and in the Purpoſes of God concerning Mankinde before.</p>
                  <p>But alas, Mankinde fallen are not onely ſinners and Enemies to God, but therethrough naturally deaf, blinde, in darkneſs, and dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and ſo unable to diſcern the grace in theſe Promiſes diſcovered, much more unable to believe and turn in to
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:135210:225"/>Chriſt, and ſo come upon this Foundation, that they may be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and born of this Seed: and what hope then? to this the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Promiſes give anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Head or Branches of Promiſes are through Chriſt that hath thus far finiſhed his work, and for his ſake to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, the Sons of Men: for though in and through the infinite Love and Mercy of God, the former Promiſes might be, and were both made and performed to Mankinde ſimply, as fallen and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, his Truth and Juſtice not gainſaying; yet the Promiſes now to be ſpoken of, could not be made, much leſs performed, if a ranſome and Atonement had not been found; in which Truth is fulfilled, and Juſtice executed, and ſo ſatisfied; which is onely in the Death, Reſurrection and Sacrifice of Chriſt that made the Atonement, and wrought Redemption in the Nature of Man,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>viz.

                  <p>It is before ſhewn, That for giving and ſending forth Chriſt the Saviour of the World, the Promiſe was abſolute, and not with, If Men believe; and ſo the Promiſes for fitting, ſupporting, exalting and furniſhing Chriſt to be ſuch a Saviour, all depended onely on the faithfulneſs of God: and though it was for the good of Mankinde; yet the performance of thoſe Promiſes was not made with an <hi>if men believe:</hi> and ſo the Promiſes for means to be uſed, and ſpirit ſent forth therein, to the opening of the eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that men might believe, were not made to be performed, if men believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all this is done, and theſe Promiſes all to ſinners, as ſinners, and performed to them alſo, before any of them believe, and to many that come not in to believe. But now when God hath manifeſted all theſe Promiſes, ſo graciouſly performed, that the ears and eyes of Men are open, ſo as they hear and ſee, and
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:135210:227"/>he moveth at their hearts, the Promiſes then run thus: If they in ſeeing ſee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if they turn at his reproof, if they hearken and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, he will ſave them, open his words, and pour cut his Spirit to them, draw them to Chriſt, enable them to believe: and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is this, when nothing is required, but what God hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly fore-given, in giving them to ſee? that by the ſame grace, they might uſe their ſight,<note place="margin">

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:135210:227"/>them hold true in a full ſenſe in the Promiſes to be ſpoken of: for it is evident, That thoſe to whom the firſt Branch of Promiſes is made known, and the ſecond Branch of Promiſes extended, and ſo received, as thereby they are found believing in Chriſt; theſe, though they are ſinners, and as ſinners, may ſtill have the uſe of all the former Promiſes; and ſo his Saying true in reſpect of thoſe Promiſes ſtill, yet are theſe in ſome better condition, and under ſome better qualification alſo, elſe the Holy Spirit would not call them, The Children of the Free Woman, The Sons of God, Saints, and Faithful in Chriſt, waſhed, ſanctified and juſtified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tranſlated out of the power of darkneſs into the Kingdom of his dear Son: this is a better condition, and better qualifications, then onely ſinners, and as ſinners: and ſome are brought to, and ſo found in other and better condition. Beſides, upon due ſearch it will be found, That the Promiſes we are to treat of, were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally made to Chriſt, and have their fulneſs of performance in him, and are derived from him to Believers under divers qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and exerciſes, as appears in the next Branch.</p>
                  <p>The third Head or Branch of Promiſes are thoſe to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to ſuch of Mankinde fallen, after they come in to believe; and they are thoſe that are confirmed in Chriſt, made through Chriſt, to be derived and received from Chriſt for Believers, and ſo through Chriſt to Believers, and to be received by Believers, ſuch as are already Believers: and in all theſe Promiſes to be ſpoken of, this is taken as granted without queſtion, they are Believers, and have Faith already, to whom theſe following Promiſes are made: ſo as here is no condition required to be ſought or brought, but onely the uſe and exerciſe of that, which of it ſelf is working, and fore-freely given; not an ear but the uſe of an ear to hear, given; not an eye, but the uſe of an eye to ſee, freely given; not a mouth, but the uſe of a mouth, given; not a hand, but the uſe of a hand, given; not ſimply life from death, but the exerciſe of life freely fore-given. So that here is fitneſs, capacity and furniture, as well as intereſt to receive theſe Promiſes, and onely uſefulneſs of that given, which apts alſo to uſefulneſs required for receiving theſe Promiſes; which are not made to all Men, nor to any Men ſimply as ſinners, and under no other conſideration or qualification; yea, they are not directly made to any unbelievers upon condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; but onely ſo propounded, that whoever believeth in Chriſt,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:135210:228"/>ſhall in that believing receive that grace, which will intereſt them in them all: ſo as they then appertain to him, being a Believer, and not before; for the Promiſes to be ſpoken of, are made to Believers, the Diſciples and Scholars of Chriſt: and theſe may be ranked into four ſorts: 1. To Believers in ſeveral ſpiritual frames and exerciſes: 2. To Believers abiding in their Faith, Confidence and Love. 3. To Believers for their abiding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4.

                  <p>I anſwer, This implies that <hi>Adam</hi> knew the Nature of all the Trees; and ſhews the great Liberty that God gave him, in his delightful buſineſs of dreſſing the Garden, to eat of them all but one; and ſhewed him the danger of eating of that one, to keep him from it: and therein gave him both the Oportunity and Liberty of exerciſing the Freedom of his Will, in ſhewing forth his well-pleaſedneſs with, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of abiding in the way of his Creator, which elſe he had been in a ſort neceſſitated to; and could not have ſhewn forth that Freedom, as now he might. And this is not like a Covenant of Works, enjoyning Works, unleſs any will have a ceaſing from one Work to be the Works, to which if any ſhould tempt him, he could not plead want, faſting,<note place="margin">

                  <p>So that by all I can finde, The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was under a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, Grace obliging, and Grace given lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſo at leaſt a gracious Covenant: and ſo was all Mankinde at firſt in him, during his innocency; unleſs one ſhould deny any thing freely from God to be of Grace, and free and undeſerved Favour, but onely forgiveneſs of ſins, and that which follows thereupon; and ſo exclude not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, but the Holy Angels alſo from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Grace or free Favour.

<pb n="464" facs="tcp:135210:254"/>he loſt his righteous Diſpoſition and aptitude to love God and his Neigbour: the Law of Righteouſneſs was now out of his heart, and a contrary Diſpoſition ſprung up therein from the poyſonous VVord of the Serpent received: and ſo he, and all Mankinde in him, fell under the Covenant and Law of VVorks; for, though Man by ſinning loſt his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Strength, yet God loſt not his Authority, nor were all the good things fore-conferred on <hi>Adam,</hi> leſs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or leſs obliging then before his fall;<note place="margin">

Now God did not make ſuch a Covenant as this with <hi>Adam</hi> at the firſt; but Man through his willing Tranſgreſſion fell under it, and by God's juſt Judgement it took hold of Man, and he was under it. And this is the Law and Covenant under which Mankinde fell in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and by which they ſhould have been judged, and were ſentenced to the firſt death; in which, if they had come to ſuffer it, according to the Judgement and curſe of the Law, they could not have overcome it, and riſen again; but muſt have periſhed in it for ever. But God in his great Love and Pity to Mankinde, found out one that was willing and mighty to ſtep in and undertake this Cure, even his own Son Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond publick Man: of whom now.</p>

<pb n="465" facs="tcp:135210:254"/>publick Man, and all Mankinde in him were fallen, and that alſo, by which their weakneſs they were liable to be under for a time, and ſo he was made under the Law,<note place="margin">

                  <p>So that the Covenant fore-made by God with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde through Chriſt, was not in this Covenant nulled or made void, or weakned; but included, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and farther help for the Obſervance of it, afforded to all the Circumciſed, with greater Encouragement by the Goſpel more cleerly taught, and the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant held forth, to all that were or came to be of this Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Circumciſion: ſo, that the everlaſting Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> by having Circumciſion annex'd, did

Surely, this free and everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is a bleſſed Covenant, no Covenant beyond it, nor any could be good for us, that ſhould in any ſort make this void. So that we look for no other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but onely for another manner of making this, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in Performance, (of which after.) And in the mean ſeaſon, we will enquire about ſuch Covenants-making as are for our fartherance and help in waiting for this. And as we read of a three-fold Performance of this Covenant, in three ſeveral times, firſt, In a literal part of it, when God did give the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> reſt in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nann</hi> by <hi>Joſhua;</hi> Secondly, In the ſpirituall part of it, to the Souls of Believers, when God ſent Jeſus Chriſt into the World, and gave him for a Covenant; and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be fully made according to Spirit and Letter in Performance at Chriſt his glorious coming: ſo we ſhall finde a glorious Covenant made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> to tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor them till Chriſt's firſt coming; and a Covenant made with all that believe in Chriſt, as he hath come in the fleſh, and is given for a Covenant to tutor them till his next coming, when the full will be given them.

                  <p>And this forementioned Law, given to this end, was the Covenant made with them: in which we may cleerly ſee, That the Covenant at firſt made through Chriſt with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, is not taken away from them in this; much leſs, made null or void by it to any Man, no, not to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and more cleerly opened, with a great deal more uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for their obſervance and benefit by it, afforded in it.

Secondly, In the Diſpenſation of his Goodneſs and Spirit through Chriſt, he hath given by Chriſt a New Teſtament, for the nurture and guidance of Believers and Receivers to the Inheritance. And laſtly, In the coming again of Chriſt, the making the Covenant by a compleat Performance. I ſhall confider each of theſe.</p>

In all which Agreements and Differences between them, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the New Teſtament above the Old, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what probably the New Teſtament is.

                  <p n="2">2. That chiefly to be minded, is that general and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Rule,<note place="margin">

                  <p>This is very true alſo, and Jeſus Chriſt is ſo the Mediator al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: but yet the Mediation here treated of, is a Mediation for thoſe, who by his former Mediation are brought in to him, and in Covenant with him: for it is the Mediation of a new Covenant coming in after, and making old that by <hi>Moſes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was firſt called and found faithful with God, and then he made the everlaſting Covenant abſolutely with him,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:135210:273"/>which was confirmed in Chriſt the Mediator, but not then mentioning a Mediator to mediate for his enjoyment of it, being immediately given. But when a Covenant is expreſt to be given in the hands of a Mediator, and the Mediator ſet to be the Mediator of that Covenant, that thoſe covenanted with may receive and enjoy that promiſed; there is an import of ſome weakneſſes, and breaches, and dangers thereby, in thoſe for whom the Mediation is made, that they may be preſerved to receive. Till I ſaw this, I judged the firſt Fruits of the everlaſting Covenant, to be the New Teſtament verily and onely; and ſo this New Teſtament to be as abſolutely made, and as free from all reſpect of any thing on the Believers part, as the Covenant made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was, or that with <hi>Noah</hi> either.

This being his work, to waſh and cleanſe Believers, that he may preſent them ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and to give them beauty for aſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that here is ſtrong conſolation againſt our weakneſs. And in all hitherto ſaid, we may diſcern, that the New Teſtament is ſomething more then the Declaration of the Goſpel as now come forth, in mentioning the beginnings, or declaring the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> or declaring the New Teſtament it ſelf: and yet ſomething leſs then the New Covenant as made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> or as to be made with him and all his Seed together: and though a Diſpenſation of the firſt Fruits of the Spirit of the everlaſting Covenant, be in this New Teſtament; yet that is alſo according to the New Teſtament, both held forth and diſpenſed: and if that already ſaid, will not ſhew what it is, I will aſſay to more cleerneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For Scripture Expreſſions to help us, I ſhall put a few to be conſidered, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The Law was given by Moſes, but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Christ.</hi> Here is firſt affirmed, That <hi>the Law,</hi> that requiring ſo exact a Righteouſneſs as it
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:135210:274"/>diſcovered, and in every one ſin ſentenced to the Curſe; yea, even for the leaſt ſhort coming, and ſo killing, and that of <hi>Levi</hi> and the Prieſthood enjoyning ſo many Sacrifices and Ceremonies to be done, or elſe every Tranſgreſſion received a juſt Recompence of Reward; and though done, yet they did not purifie the Conſcience, nor make the comers to them or doers of them perfect; but onely ſhadowed out him that was to come, that they might look to him and be ſaved. This Law <hi>came by Moſes: God</hi> gave this Covenant by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: <hi>Grace,</hi> that is, free, undeſerved and rich Favour and Mercy, in forgiving ſins, and accepting into Favour and Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by Jeſus Chriſt that died for our ſins, and ſo fulfilled Truth, and ſatisfied Juſtice, and ſo made the Atonement, and roſe juſt, as the publick Man, for our Juſtification, and aſcended to Heaven, and offered the acceptable Sacrifice, and obtained eternal Redemption; and ſo is the Propitiation for our ſins, and Grace is onely by him. <hi>And Truth:</hi> that is, fulfilling of the Promiſes, he being immeaſurably filled with the Holy Ghoſt in our Nature, and the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelling in him bodily, he is The Temple of God, the High-Prieſt, The Laver of Regeneration, the Altar, the Sacrifice, The Propitiatory, The Oracle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Truth of all figured by thoſe is in him, and ſo by him, and had in having him: and this vertuous from the beginning; and ſo even then, though in a more hidden way, <hi>Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Christ.</hi> But now he hath come and done his firſt Work, this myſtery is manifeſted, and the Spirit hath teſtified of him: and this Teſtimony is Spirit and Life, by which ſuch as are led to believe in Chriſt, do meet with Truth, and ſo are ſaid to worſhip him in Spirit (this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Law oppoſed to that of Works and Types) and in Truth, (acknowledging the Truth in Chriſt, and meeting with him in believing on him, as having done his firſt work for them,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Of the Everlasting Covenant as remaining to be made.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is evident, That the Covenant remaining to be made is no other but a new manner of making of the ſame everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant that was made with and confirmed in Chriſt at the beginning, for him and his ſpiritual Seed; and after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, as confirmed in Chriſt to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately made with him, and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> for them and their Seed, which ſhould be of the ſame Seed ſtill: and afterward in reſpect of the King and Kingdom, ſo alſo made with <hi>David,</hi> for him and his Seed, which ſhould be of the ſame Seed ſtill; and ſo becauſe this Covenant was firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to, and made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> it is called God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and becauſe it was after in like manner made with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Abraham</hi>'s Sons, and ſo every of all thoſe three being the Fathers of all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> therefore it is called, The Covenant of their Fathers; and becauſe in reſpect of the Kingdom, it was after alſo ſo made with <hi>David,</hi> it is ſometimes called, The Covenant made with <hi>David:</hi> and this Covenant ſtill called, The everlaſting Covenant, and The Covenant of the Fathers; which was made to theſe Fathers for them, and for their Seed, to wait for the performance thereof by Faith, the firſt Teſtamental Covenant given in the beginning of a literal performance,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:135210:279"/>was for nurture of the Seed till Chriſt came, and then to be ſhaken and paſs away; and the Second or New Teſtamental Covenant given in the Diſpenſation of the ſpiritual firſt Fruits of the everlaſting Covenant, to nurture Sons for walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Faith and Love, till they come to the Inheritance, when the fulneſs of the Everlaſting Covenant will be performed to Soul and Body both; when, though the firſt Fruits abide in the Harveſt,<note place="margin">

The Time when it is to be made: 2. The Perſons with whom it is to be made: and 3. What is to be done in this manner of making it; all included, and not darkly, but cleerly intimated and expreſt, in that known place,<note place="margin">

And ſo likewiſe for the People of other Nations that ſhall be joyned with them; yea, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt then receive the performance of this Covenant ſo made; yea, <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> muſt be there, to receive their part with many that ſhall riſe out of the duſt of the Earth; yea, all the whole ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> even we that are of the Gentiles; yea, as the Covenant was firſt made with Chriſt, and through him a Covenant for Mankinde; ſo all his Seed by Miniſtration thereof: and ſo <hi>Adam, Abel, Seth, Enoch,</hi> &amp;c. In a word, None ſhall prevent another, but all that are in the duſt, and ſleep in Jeſus, ſhall ariſe, &amp; living Saints be changed, &amp; all together meet the Lord, and be, and come with him; for then is the time in which he will give rewards to his Servants the Prophets, and to the Saints, and to them that fear his Name, both ſmall and great.

                  <p>But to this, it may be ſome be replied, That <hi>then after this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſo made, there muſt be no more converſion, no encreaſe of the Seed, for then the Covenant muſt be made again, or elſe it will not be made with all the Seed; and if ſo, then not with all at once.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, That ſome whoſe labors I reverence and eſteem, and them for their works ſake, do ſo conceive, That as that Kingdom ſhall be ſinleſs and ſorrowleſs, ſo it ſhall be converſionleſs: there ſhall be no more converted after that Kingdom is ſet up: but the Reaſon given thereof, is not this I am to anſwer, but another, namely, That all that have part in the firſt Reſurrection, even all the Saints that live and raign with Chriſt, ſhall raign with him a thouſand yeers,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:135210:281"/>the whole time of his raign, as Man, till he deliver up the Kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all. Whence this Suppoſition, If any ſhould after the beginning, and ſome time of the Kingdom run out, be converted, they could not raign the full thouſand yeers: One Anſwer will ſerve both theſe Reaſons, which is this, That it is nowhere ſaid, That all the Inhabitants of this new Earth, or all the Members of this Commonwealth ſhall ſit upon Thrones, and raign: nor is it ſaid, That all the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that are then living in unbelief, and the unbelieving Gentiles with them, that ſhall be converted at and by the perſonal and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and all his Saints with him, and ſo made of the Seed, that they ſhall all be Kings, and raign with him: (they come in after the time of thoſe to whom that Promiſe is.) And ſurely, for ſuch as never ſuffered, never waited for him, but are ſo ſuddenly, and with ſo mighty a Hand brought in; it may be counted happineſs enough, to live in ſuch a Commonwealth, and be free Denizens therein, and enjoy the pleaſures of ſuch a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, till they be ſwallowed up with the unconceivable joy of the Father and Son, when God ſhall be all in all, which alone will ſatisfie all that are received into it: and the Promiſe of raigning, is to ſuch as here in this ſuffering time, live and die in the Faith, or are found ſo believing on him at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, that they may be changed while the other are raiſed, and ſo come together with the Lord, which the after-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terted do not. And ſo thoſe that are the Children of the Reſurrection that are raiſed or changed in one and the ſame moment at his coming, be all that I, and I ſuppoſe that any other can finde the Promiſe of raigning appertain unto. And if I ſhould ſay, Theſe are the whole of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titual Seed, I ſhould not erre, whether Men receive it, or no: for all the ſpiritual Seed from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time ſo called; and if I ſhall add the Seed of Chriſt, the Seed of the Woman, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> though a ſpiritual Seed, yet not immediately ſo, but mediately through a ſpiritual operation,<note place="margin">

                  <p>IN what hath been ſhewn, we may ſee, if we ſearch and read the Scriptures pointed unto, That the Goſpel of God and the Teſtimony of Chriſt therein, is according to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of God, and the Opener thereof; and alſo, That the Teſtimony of Chriſt, The Purpoſes of God, The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, and The Covenants of God agree in one and the ſame; The Revelations of Chriſt, ſhew forth the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Chriſt, which is the Key of Knowledge: The Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Chriſt declareth The Purpoſe of God; from his Purpoſe, The Promiſes of things purpoſed, and as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,

                  <p n="1">I. We have that ſet before us, which is already performed in Chriſt, which is true, and truely done, as a motive to, and Foundation for Faith; and declared, that Men might believe, whether men do believe it or not. And alſo that ſet before us, which will certainly be done to men, that they might believe, whether Men receive it or reject it: and this to give Preachers hope in declaring the Goſpel; and Hearers caution, that they then receive his words and ſlip not the day of his viſitation. And alſo that ſet before us, which Believers may through Faith, daily look for in this life: and what they are to wait for till, and through Faith, may be ſure to enjoy in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſurely, as in the Goſpel-Teſtimony, Purpoſes and Promiſes; ſo in the Covenants we may ſee a fulneſs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for us: a ſweet gracious order in them all, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Grace with Mercy, Truth and Holineſs in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them, all mentioned in his Word, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidenced and intimated in the Works of God already done, ſo as they have a ſweet and drawing influence, both to draw ſuch as yet believe not, to believe, and to ſtabliſh Believers for their perſeverance: I ſay, The Covenants of God have: but not ſuch as expreſt or intimated by Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 163.4.</note> ſaying, <hi>The diſtributive juſtice of God is engaged upon this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt upon the Covenant and Compact made with Christ as Mediator to that purpoſe, to bestow on them for whom he died, all the good things which he promiſed him for them, in and upon the account of his undertaking in their behalf:</hi> So he. Sure this Saying hath not the ſavour of the Scripture-Language, in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, Promiſes, Purpoſes, or Teſtimony of his Oblation and Mediation, which are all plain, and without wreathed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, holding forth their own meaning, and the certain Truth in that affirmed. Now certain it is, and is before ſhewn, That what God engaged for to Chriſt upon the account of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.6, 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.21.</note> he performed to Chriſt upon the account of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; &amp; what upon that account he engageth to Chriſt to do unto men, both hath &amp; ſhall be upon that account done to men,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:135210:288"/>all Men, as is foreſhewn: and what upon the account of his extention in Miniſtration of the vertues of his Sufferings and Sacrifice, was engaged to him to be done for his ſake, hath and ſhall verily be done unto them: and yet upon both theſe accounts; in the firſt, having bought them; in the ſecond, uſing means to lead them to Repentance, he ſhall rule ſome with a Rod of Iron, and break them in pieces like a Potter's Veſſel for their Rebellions, and have the glory of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Sacrifice for them, and means uſed towards them in his juſt condemnation of them according to the Goſpel. Therefore though God upon the account of the Oblation of Chriſt, hath given in to him eternal Life, as in a publick Man for all Men, for whom indeed he died, yet not to be on that account diſpenſed to all for whom he died; but on thoſe, that by and in the means he uſeth, believe on him: as hath been foreſhewn in the Teſtimony of the Oblation and Mediation of Chriſt, and in the Purpoſes, Promiſes and Covenants of God, and in anſwer of Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> his more plain Expreſſions: ſo ſwerving from his own Rule.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In this manner of God's making his Covenants, we have a good and ſure Direction to know what Covenants we are under, and what our Intereſt in the Covenant is, and how far we are in Covenant with God, and ſo what we have in enjoyment, and what in hope to enjoy, if we view the Covenant in which our Father <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt, and from which he fell; and then view that heavy Covenant he, and we all in him fell under: and withall, view how the ſecond publick Man, the Lord Chriſt, became under that heavy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for Mankinde, and hath fully ſatisfied the ſame: and view how upon the account of ſatisfying this heavy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, there is a gracious Covenant between the Father and him, and that alſo reſpecting Mankinde to be now in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and he to have a Seed out of them, and to have for and give to his Seed eternal Life: And if believing all this, we view the Covenant God made with Mankinde through Chriſt at the beginning; we ſhall ſee, That we are under a gracious Covenant; and, That, if according as our eyes are opened, and Light, Motion and Strength in the means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to us, given us, we ſo believe in God, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:135210:288"/>to the gracious Covenant, under the hope of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. And then if we view the Covenant as made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the firſt Fathers, and believe the ſame, we are under the hope of it: and then, if we view the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſion, and given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to continue till Chriſt came, and look on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus as ſet forth in the Goſpel; we ſhall ſee how Chriſt hath ſatisfied and made purgation for all the ſins, the one part of that Covenant could charge us with; and fulfilled all that in Truth which the other part of that Covenant did figure and type out; and freed us from outward Circumciſion, and all the Bondage of the Law of Works; that believing in his Blood, we may therethrough approach to God, and believe in and receive from him, all ſaving Grace, we ſhall finde a better uſe of that old Covenant for inſtruction, now being from under it, then thoſe that were under it in Obſervances, did or could finde. And ſee therein the firſt Covenant made with Mankinde through Chriſt, cleared; and the Door to Life and Immortality opened, with the hope of the everlaſting Covenant ſet before us, and Jeſus Chriſt given for a Covenant; holding forth the New Teſtament to us: in minding and believing in him with our heart, he writeth his minde in the Heart, enduing us with the Spirit of Faith, Love, and Power, and a ſound Minde; ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting us in the Promiſes and everlaſting Covenant, leading us to live by Faith, and walk in Love, in which he ſealeth us for his, and gives us a firſt Fruits of the Spirit, as an earneſt of the Inheritance. And ſo we are under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which Chriſt is the Mediator by vertue of his Blood, That we which are called, may receive the promiſed Inheritance: and he is loving, faithful, and able; yea, and given us of God for the everlaſting Covenant it ſelf, That we believing on him, and receiving him, may in and with him receive all things; and he by his power, keep us through Faith, till he have conferred all things in the Covenant on us. So that till poſſeſſion, we can have no better or greater aſſurance of our intereſt in, and enjoyment of all promiſed in the everlaſting Covenant, then the aſſurance by Faith in him of his fulneſs, and our intereſt in him, and enjoyment of
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:135210:289"/>him, who ſaith, Becauſe he liveth, we that believe in him ſhall live alſo: and it is better and ſafer for us, that it is in his Hands, then if it were in ours; we may better betruſt him then our ſelves, for keeping it. And knowing all this revealed in the Revelation of Chriſt, and ſo teſtified in the Teſtimony of Chriſt, and therein the Purpoſes of God to be declared to be ſuch; and according thereto, the Promiſes of God given forth, and all the Promiſes aſſured by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and now Chriſt given us for all, ſo as believing in him, he is ours; and he being ours, all that is his is ours, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Spirit, Promiſes, Covenant, Inheritance; and we his, as is all plentifully ſhewn and proved before in this Treatiſe: Who then can deſire a better, firmer, and ſtronger aſſurance of God being ours, and with us, to preſerve us to the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance? I confeſs I have formerly fancied ſome more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and perſonal thing, in which I now ſee I was miſtaken. And becauſe I meet with Expreſſions importing the ſame in others, I owning it, as my own former miſtake, will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to remove it from others, in conſidering one Expreſſion more of Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s; of whoſe minde in that alſo, I conceive my ſelf to have been.</p>

<pb n="542" facs="tcp:135210:297"/>alſo; and ſo in believing, receiving the Teſtimony, is in Men Faith; But God hath provided no Object of Faith for the Devils; and ſo for believing by Knowledge, Sight and Senſe, they do know, that is, ſo believe, that the Man Jeſus Chriſt took neither their Nature nor Cauſe on him, and ſo did not die, or work any Redemption for them, but took on him the Nature and Cauſe of Mankinde, (whom the Devil had overthrown) and came to ſave Men, and of Purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the Devil; and that there is no door of Repentance for them; but he hath deſtroyed his firſt work al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and is about deſtroying his ſecond, and will utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, &amp; in his time ſhut him up in priſon for a time, bound, and after caſt him into a Lake of fire, tormenting him for all the miſchiefs he hath done to Mankinde, and to his People: he knows that God in Chriſt is one, and will thus torment him; and this certainty of his knowledge, and ſo believing, makes him tremble at the minding of his own Damnation. Now I hope none will put the Sons of Men in the ſame ſpecies or rank and order with the Devils, as that Chriſt took not their Nature and Cauſe on him, hath wrought no Redemption for them, nor opened any Door of Repentance to them, but came to aggravate their ſins, and ſo to damn them to the ſame puniſhment with the Devils. If any ſhould believe thus, they ſhould believe as falſly, as the Devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve truely: But on the contrary, if any Man do by hearing the Teſtimony of Chriſt, as verily believe Jeſus Chriſt to have taken the Nature and Cauſe of Mankinde on him, and ſo to have died for our ſins, and offered up the acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, and ſo to be the Propitiation for the ſins of the World, and God through him propitious to Mankinde, and ſo a Juſtifier of ſinners that believe in Jeſus, and all this for the good of Mankinde that they might believe, and in believing be ſaved; This will fill a Man with Conſolation and Hope, as verily as the Devils believing the Truth of all this to be againſt them, doth fill them with trembling: and ſo believing, in the Devils, is neither having of Faith, it makes them averſe to it; but ſuch believing in a Man as cloſeth with the Object of Faith, and receives influences from it, is Faith. Hence
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:135210:297"/>the Apoſtle proveth, That though a Man believe there is one God; yet ſeeing God is in Chriſt propitions, if that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth work not up confidence and love to bring forth Fruits, either it is no Faith, he hath never yet been united to the Object; or if he were, he is withdrawn, and ſo hath loſt the Spirit and Life of Faith, and ſo his Faith is become dead, like the Body of a Man when the Soul and Spirit is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo that if the Faith in a Man, be as real and true in its kinde, cloſing with the Object, as the believing of the Devils is true in their kinde, filling them with enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that believed, then that Faith is right, and in a Man as verily ſaving, as to the Devils an occaſion of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this Repentance is effected by the Goſpel, diſcovering Chriſt, as having died for our ſins, and roſe for our juſtification, and given himſelf a Sacrifice to God for us, and uſed means to bring us to himſelf: which beheld and minded, it makes appear the vileneſs of our ſinſulneſs, and vanity of our righteouſneſs, that could not be pardoned without ſo great ſufferings of ſo mighty a one; and the odiouſneſs of our continuance in ſinning againſt one, ſo great and glorious; and yet ſo loving, even to ſuch Enemies as we, and his love commended through ſuch Blood ſhed for us: and this ſeen, melteth the heart with ſorrow for evils, and turneth the bent of the heart to him; yea, without this there is no door of Repentance, or any hope in it; for the Law of Works ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not of Repentance after ſin committed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</note> but bindes over to the Curſe; ſo, as Repentance is bootleſs and in vain, under and by that Covenant;<note place="margin">

<pb n="557" facs="tcp:135210:307"/>as of Faith: ſo that whoever knoweth and believeth him the Propitiation for the ſins of the World, hath a good ground of Repentance and turning to God; nor ſhall it be in vain, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. And from this Goſpel-Meſſage believed, is the riſe of all true Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That as this Repentance is wrought by and founded on the Oblation of Chriſt made known, ſo it is the firſt thing taught and called for, in and by the diſcovery of Chriſt in the Goſpel: and in believing the Goſpel, it firſt effecteth this change, and turning of the Minde, Heart, and Way, from its former evil Judgement, Purpoſe, Affection and Way, to the Goodneſs and Grace of God, that reproveth the ſame; and ſo to its tenders and teachings: ſuch the Order of Chriſt in his Call, <hi>Turn you at my reproof,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6, 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.20, 21.</note>

                  <p n="3">3.

All which, how goodly ſoever and gainful they appear to a natural man, yet in this knowing and beholding of Chriſt, and him crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they become as loſs; and a man repenteth, and turneth from them to Chriſt, as is ſaid.</p>
                  <p>And this is the Repentance that is from dead Works, and toward God; and there is no other Repentance, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wrought, that is a Principle, or of any account in

                     <hi>Faith towards God.</hi> This is the ſame with that called Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is God over all, bleſſed for ever, and the only Medium of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and he in whom the Face of God ſhineth; ſo that it is in Scripture-Language evident, That the Principle here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Faith towards God,</hi> is the Grace or Gift of Faith to and in a man, which cloſeth with the Object of Faith, and ſo is Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Faith; for, as is foreſhewn, every believing is not Faith: the Fool believeth every thing, and the Devils believe, who yet are nowhere ſaid to have Faith; but that Belief which is of the Faith, and cloſeth with the Faith, is in Scripture called Faith: and ſo this affirmed here, as one of the firſt Principles, taught and begot by the Oracles of God, building it on the Foundation, is ſaid to be the Faith that cometh by hearing the Word of the Lord, and ſo the Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo it is,

                  </p>
                  <p>So that this Faith having imbraced the Word, is a Principle within him that believeth; for he that believeth on the Son of God, hath the Witneſs (or Teſtimony, or Record) in himſelf.

                  <p n="1">1. What laying on of hands was, uſed by Chriſt, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and firſt witneſſes, and in what manner they uſed to lay on hands. And this appears in their writings to be ſometimes, that men might receive the viſible Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; as our Saviour, to prepare his Apoſtles to receive the Holy Ghoſt, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them, and lift up his hands, and ſaid, <hi>Receive,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.22. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.5.</note>. So they prayed, and laid on their hands on Believers, that they might receive the Holy Ghoſt<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 8.15, 17, <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.6.</note>: and ſometimes they uſed this for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous curing and healing of Diſeaſes<note n="c" place="margin">

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 6.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.</note>: and ſometime for fitneſs; and a bleſſing for Meſſengers ſent by the Church about Church-Affairs<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3.</note>. And the manner of their laying on of hands was with prayer to God, for that they deſired for thoſe on whom hands are to be laid<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 8.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.8.</note>: in deſire whereof, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God for his gracious Anſwer, they lift up their hands
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:135210:311"/>to God<note n="g" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.</note>: whence Prayer is ſo named, lifting up the hands to God<note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2.</note> and in Teſtimony of their deſire and confidence in God for his gracious anſwering, they laid on hand on the parties prayed for<note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 8.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.8.</note>. Such, and in ſuch manner their laying on of hands.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Doctrine of laying on of hands, it is that Doctrine or teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel of Chriſt and him crucified, in which Believers are directed and encouraged to pray for good things to God, with Promiſes of a gracious hearing, that ſo they may pray, and lift up hearts and hands in confidence in God, and lay on hands in Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony thereof. And this being one of thoſe Principles, that by the Oracles of God were taught to all Believers of the Oblation of Chriſt, it muſt needs be as common to all Saints, as the Faith of the Oblation of Chriſt, and the Oracles proceeding from it, known and believed: and ſo it cannot be meant of the act of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands, for giving and receiving the viſible Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, for ſpeaking with other Tongues; for ſuch laying on of hands, appears to be peculiar to the Apoſtles, and was not common to all the firſt Witneſſes.<note place="margin">

And they in whom this perſwaſion and principle is, are ſuch as in whom Chriſt is ſpiritually in ſome meaſure formed, even ſo far, as that from the belief and knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and him erucified, all the forementioned Principles are in a gracious meaſure in them; and ſo with them this alſo: By all which they are framed, both with deſites and patience, to expect, and in well-doing to wait for the coming of the Lord.</p>

The firſt two, which are Repentance from dead works, and Faith towards God, being thoſe in which working, the Believer is taken out from his eſtimate of himſelf and the world, and the fleſh, with affections and lufts thereof crucified, and he drawn to high eſtimates of Chriſt, and by Faith and Love united to him. The ſecond two, that is, the Doctrine of Baptiſms, and of laying on of hands, be thoſe in which the Believer is formed more and more to Chriſt, in fellowſhip with him, and conformity
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:135210:319"/>to him in his death, and likewiſe in the ſpiritual vertue of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, with enjoyment and experiments of his goodneſs in his Promiſes. The third two, that is, the Doctine of Reſurrection of the dead, and of eternal Judgement, be thoſe in which the Believer is quickned up in hope of eternal life &amp; inheritance, and encouraged with conſtancy and patience to expect and wait for the coming of Chriſt, then to enjoy all the good promiſed. All theſe mentioned, he ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.3. <hi>And this will we do, if God permit:</hi> as if one ſhould ſay.

And ſo hee ſaith, not only they have fallen away, and have crucified, but they are even now ſtill ſo doing, they fall away, they crucifie, &amp;c. that is their buſineſs. And they are ſo doing, <hi>it is impoſſible,</hi> and therefore <hi>impoſſible to renew them again to Repentance;</hi> the words are very plain in themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That this great danger of eternall damnation into which ſome have fallen, is in ſome caſes to bee declared,<note place="margin">Chap. 2, 3, 4, 6, 10.</note> and ſet before them that are not fallen into it, that they may be warned to avoid all thoſe evils by which by degrees,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> if not avoided, they may bee brought to fall into it. And ſo the Apoſtle ſets this danger before the Hebrews, to warn them to avoid all that leads to it, as hath been ſhown. And ſo did he to the <hi>Galatians:</hi> And ſo hee directs them to no other or better faith than here ſet forth, which ſuppoſe ſome were fallen from, yet hee would have them abide and bee ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and grow in this faith; and if any ſay, God cannot ſo proceed with ſuch as once have ſuch faith, though they fall away.

                     <pb n="596" facs="tcp:135210:327"/>The Apoſtle here ſetteth forth the holineſs and juſtneſs of Gods proceedings; that as their ſtanding is by faith, ſo they may take heed of preſumptuouſneſs; as he admoniſhed the <hi>Romans;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11.18.23.</note> So here the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſtill juſtifying God, as by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the height and grievouſneſs of ſuch ſinning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the ſin of the Angels that fell, having no cauſe for it,<note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> they had happineſs enough in their condition, in which abiding they might have been eſtabliſhed; but aſpiring after a higher eſtate, they left their habitation, &amp;c.

For the Earth on which a man beſtows the ſame labour and coſt for til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, ſeeding, dreſſing: and then it receives the ſame bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Heaven, in the heat and influences of the Sun, and the former and latter Rain falling often upon it, and drunk in by it: if any of this bee wanting, the Earth is not condemned, but if it have all this, and then bring forth Herbs Corn, or other fruit, meet for thoſe by whom it is dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it receiveth bleſſing from God. As men will gather and accept that fruit, and bee well pleaſed with ſuch ground; and bleſſe God for it. So God will accept and bleſs ſuch as according to his grace extended, bring forth ſuitable fruits: But that part of the Earth which hath had the ſame <hi>labour, coſt, tillage, ſeed, and dreſſing beſtowed upon it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſame bleſſing of the Sun, and the Rain, and drunk it in,</hi> as the former did (elſe the faultineſs will not be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the ground) <hi>and brings forth briars and thorns, is rejected, &amp;c.</hi> So here is equall and juſt proceeding.

                  <p>It had been good hee had explicated the meaning of his terms; for its already proved the compleating of the work of Regeneration, and making new Creatures, is in the Reſurrection of the juſt; and that the firſt fruits is in begetting us by his word to beleeve in his Son: But that the Holy Ghoſt operateth more or leſs, in giving the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Chriſt, working repentance from dead works, and faith towards God, to work any change or alteration, like Regeneration, that is not it, according to the meaſure and degrees of his working; none that know God, and Chriſt, or the Spirit according to Goſpell declaration will beleeve, that many fain and pretend what they are not, that many reſiſt his operations, that many are not yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with to beleeve on him, Is true.

And then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſuiting the works of the Spirit to all theſe, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, enlightening, taſte of the heavenly gift, partaking of the Holy Ghoſt, taſte of the good word of God, and of the powers of the World to come: are theſe Terms, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5. no expreſſions or mention of faith, or beleeving, or in terms equivalent?

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2 Not any thing here ſpoken of, as aſcribed to the perſons ſpoken of, which is peculiar to Beleevers, or that conſtitutes them to bee ſuch, called according to purpoſe, quickened, born again, or regenerated, juſtified, united to Chriſt, ſanctified by the Spirit, adopted; made the Sons of God. Bee the uſuall expreſſions of Beleevers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is clear; here is as much ſaid of theſe, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the works to the Holy Ghoſt, and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the receits and taſtes ſpoken of; while they are yet in the ſuppoſition, and not departed; as is ſaid of any
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:135210:333"/>of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to whom this Epiſtle is written. Indeed when any ſuch are fallen away, not theſe things, but other things are aſcribed to them; but it is the faith and ſpiritual operations once had, and ſtill retained by thoſe not departed, (and not the departure and crucifying Chriſt again, which is only in thoſe fallen away) we now ſpeak of. And that thoſe things which are peculiar to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, is here expreſly ſpoken of, is ſhewed and proved before at large, in opening the principles taught by the Oracles, and built upon the foundation, and the inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and operations of the Holy Ghoſt, in, and with, working up, and ſuited to thoſe principles expreſly, that I marvel, any that know the foundation, and Oracles of God, and firſt principles, and Scripture language ſhould deny it, and much more, that he that more than once hath ſaid, that upon other inferior (and not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) accounts they are frequently called, Beleevers and Saints. But in this he hath ſaid, not proved. And as for the Catalogue of terms here brought in, and affirmed to be the uſual expreſſions of beleevers, conceived to bee terms equivalent to faith, and beleeving, we may as he oppoſeth them to theſe in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4.5. conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That ſome are ſaid to have beleeved, of whom I know not where it is alſo ſaid they had faith;<note place="margin">Luke 8.13. Joh. 2.23. &amp; 8.30, 31, 32, 36.</note> for no man is ſaid in Scripture to have faith, unleſs he be obedient to the faith, ſo as he receive the teſtimony, and cloſe with the object, and have ſome uſefulneſs of it, as hath been ſhewn, yet many that beleeved, yea, ſo beleeved, that if they abode they ſhould be ſaved, where beleeving is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mentioned, yet theſe terms under conſideration, not applicable to ſuch. But whether theſe are uſually called Beleevers, I need not contend, for thoſe we treat of, are beleevers in a farther ſenſe, as hath been ſhewn.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Here are ſome of theſe terms, affirmed to be the uſual expreſſions of Beleevers, which as they are ſet down, I cannot finde at all uſed in the Scripture, as the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Beleevers, as they are in this life. As the term Regenerated, as diſtinct to being born again, as here ſet down, I read in Scripture of a Regeneration, in which
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:135210:334"/>the Apoſtles followed Chriſt.<note place="margin">Mat. 19.28. Tit. 3.5. Eph. 5.26, 27. Luke 20.35, 36</note> And of ſaving by the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Regeneration, which as it flows from Chriſt is a continued work ſtill in doing, and to be fully compleated in the reſurrection of the juſt. But that the beleevers in this life, are called, The Regenerated, I finde not at all, much leſs uſually: And ſo for the term Adopted, I finde, the Adoption (or miniſtration thereof) to have pertained to <hi>Iſrael</hi> under <hi>Moſes</hi> miniſtration,<note place="margin">Rom 9.4. Gal. 41, 2, 3. Eph. 1.5.</note> though the Tutorage of ſons, were then as ſervants. And I finde alſo the firſt Truſters in Chriſt predeſtinated. in their miniſtration, to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt: And therefore ſo to have preached Chriſt come in the fleſh, That men in beleeving might receive the Adoption of Sons,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.5.8, 23. Rom 8.15. Gal. 4.6, 7.</note> and ſo a firſt fruits of the Spirit of Adoption. And I finde that ſuch as did unfainedly beleeve in Chriſt, did receive the Spirit of Adoption into their hearts, crying, <hi>Abba Father.</hi> But this I alſo finde, That this Adoption is not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, but only begun, and a firſt firſt fruits, and that of the Spirit onely received, and thoſe that have this, do yet wait for the Adoption (injoying yet only by hope) even the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the body,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.12, 23, 24, 25.</note> when Adoption will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in the reſurrection of the Juſt. And ſo I finde not this ſaid, That beleevers are compleatly adopted; Nor is the Adopted, the uſual, or any expreſſion by which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are now called, that I finde.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Here are ſome expreſsions, which in the meaning of them are true of all beleevers in this life, as things truly and perfectly done, though for the meaſure not come to its height, and yet not as expreſſed, the uſual expreſsions of beleevers,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.2, 4, 7 Heb. 4.1, 2, 3.

And ſo one: And yet a farther uniting prayed for; yea that they might be one in will,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.20, 21.</note> purpoſe, deſign, and way: And this union of Spirit, we are exhorted to keep, and to grow up in it, till we come to the fulneſs of it;<note place="margin">Eph. 4.12, 16.</note> but it is not yet fully
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:135210:334"/>compleated; And ſo though in a ſenſe beleevers are united to Chriſt, and ſo truly ſaid to be, yet the compleatment is but a working, and growing towards. Beleevers are not very often, and uſually ſet forth by this expreſſion, The united to Chriſt. And the term, <hi>Made the Sons of God,</hi> is that which in a ſpiritual ſenſe may be affirmed of true beleevers; for to all that receive Chriſt by beleeving on him, by beleeving on his name he gives the power to bee the Sons of God, and ſo the favour to be called his Sons; and his Sons they now are by faith (and not otherwiſe yet.) And ſhall more fully and compleatly be made the Sons of God in the reſurrection of the juſt;<note place="margin">Joh. 1.12, 13. 1 Joh. 3.1. Gal. 3.26. Luke 20.35, 36 1 Joh. 3.2.</note> whence though Sons of God, be often and uſual expreſſions of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, yet made Sons of God, is not ſo uſual an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as ſome other.</p>

                  <p n="5">5 Here are ſome terms in the ſubſtance of them, though not ſo uſual, or not more uſual than the terms in the Text, here by him rejected, as he expreſſeth them, uſual terms to expreſs Beleevers, <hi>viz.

And the expreſsions in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2, 4, 5. as much ſet forth beleeving, and ſo may as well expreſs the beleever as either of them; So that all theſe expreſſions brought in, though they are all very good, yet the bringing them in, to diſcountenance and eject other expreſſions uſed in this buſineſs by the Holy Ghoſt alſo,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.14.

                  <p>For was not the laying of Chriſt for the foundation, the purpoſe, and according to the purpoſe of God? And
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:135210:335"/>was not the lifting up Jeſus in Goſpel-preaching, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying him by Spirit to the hearts of men, that they might ſee, and beleeve, the purpoſe, and according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God? And whereas ſome when light comes, would yet be wiſe in their own eyes, and ſo come in to claim by a righteouſneſs of their own, not ſubmitting to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, and ſo are not in reſpect of the prevalency of grace diſcovered, the right called ones, yet others in minding that grace diſcovered, are prevailed with, to let go all thoughts of confidence in their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c. and to beleeve in Jeſus, that they may live in him, and to him.

For the manner of their <hi>obtaining of this precious Faith,</hi> it is by Gods giving to them, that holy Spirit of his, whereby he raiſed Jeſus from the dead, to raiſe them from their death in ſin, to quicken them unto newneſs of life, endowing them with a new life, with a ſpiritual, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſupernatural habit, ſpreading it ſelf upon their whole ſouls, making them new creatures throughout (in reſpect of parts) inveſting them with an abiding prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, being a natural genuine fountain of all thoſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual acts, works and duties, which he is pleaſed to work in them, and by them of his own good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the holy and bleſſed Spirit which effectually and powerfully works this change in them, is beſtowed upon them, as a fruit of the purchaſe and interceſsion of Jeſus Chriſt, to dwell in them, and abide in them for ever; Upon the account of which inhabitation of the Spirit of Chriſt in them, they have union with him, <hi>i. e.</hi> one and the ſame Spirit, dwelling in him the head, and them the members.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By all which as to their actual ſtate and condition, they are really changed from death to life, and from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, from an univerſal habit of uncleanneſs unto holineſs, and from a ſtate of enmity, ſtubbornneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into a ſtate of love obedience, delight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as to their relative condition, whereas they were children of wrath, under the curſe and condemning power of the Law.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the difficulty lyeth in what ſenſe <hi>Nature</hi> is taken, for which I will not ſtrive. Let men take it in what ſenſe by Scripture they will.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If by <hi>Nature</hi> be meant the firſt or natural birth, as men come from <hi>Adam</hi> by propagation, and ſo ſinners,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12, 18, 19.</note> and bear his image which is common to all men. Then it
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:135210:341"/>overthrows the fancy of ſome, a certain number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſevered from others, before they were born, to be an elect people to Son-ſhip, and eternal life; for if any were ſo elect as <hi>Adams</hi> ſons from eternity, before the world was, then were they not born, or by birth, <hi>The children of wrath even as others;</hi> no, there would be a great and wide difference; in humane things men will eaſily diſcern it. If one man had by high Treaſon procured on himſelf, and all his poſterity, the ſentence of ejection from all his lands and inheritance, and of ſuffering for ever an ignominious and tormenting death, being for ever put under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, wrath and hatred of him againſt whom the treaſon was committed; and yet the execution deferred till the Traytor have twenty children: And in the ſentence paſſed, this reſerve, that the third, ſeventh, tenth, and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of that mans children ſhall be freed from the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſentence, and be accepted as ſons into favour with the King, and enjoy the inheritance, though theſe may be born as ſinful, and ill-deſerving as the reſt, yet can they not be ſaid to be born, or by birth to be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the wrath and diſpleaſure of the King, even as the other, ſeeing even by their very birth, the perſons ſo born, were appointed to ſuch freedome, favour, and happineſs, as the reſt were excluded from before they were born; but if none ſo provided for, but all alike before their birth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, then were they alike the children of wrath, or elſe not. This Simily illuſtrates, the Text proveth, and Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>All are by nature the children of wrath, one even as another.</hi> And ſo as <hi>Adams</hi> ſons, none differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from others by any ſuch election, before their being, or by a firſt birth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 If by <hi>Nature</hi> be meant the corrupt diſpoſition, with which from our firſt father we are all naturally infected, and ſo according to the luſts of that diſpoſition, what ever means were uſed towards us, more than other, yet we accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the courſe of this world, and the motions of Satan, walked in fulfilling the wills of the fleſh, <hi>And ſo were by Nature the children of wrath even as others:</hi> If we take it thus as ſurely alſo we may then it ſtill overthrows the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:135210:342"/>fancy; for to be elect to Son-ſhip, and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to be well-beloved,<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.1. with Mat. 12.18.</note> and under well-pleaſedneſs, is one and the ſame, by our Saviours opening the word; to be under wrath, and under compaſsion, may well ſtand together; but to be under wrath, and well-pleaſedneſs ſtands not together, nor are any that are without Chriſt, and out of him,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.4. 1 Cor. 15.45, 46, 47.48. 1 Pet. 2.5, 9. 1 Theſſ 5.3.4 Rom. 9 25, 26.</note> choſen or elected in him; the natural man is firſt, the ſpiritual afterward, as with the head, ſo with the members: who are the elect and choſen, is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declared; and they, when elect, are not children of wrath even as others, nor as themſelves ſometimes were; ſo that in this ſaying, he hath intimately confeſſed the truth of their beleef, he profeſſedly oppoſeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſaith, That faith and holineſs which in due time they are inveſted withall, whereby they are made Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers and Saints, and diſtinguiſhed from all others what ever, is an effect, and fruit of, and flows from Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purpoſe, concerning their ſalvation, and election.</p>
                  <p>The faith and holineſs of thoſe forementioned,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.14.

And are not thoſe ſo brought to beleeve in him, beleevers indeed, and Saints by calling? And is not this faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the love of God, commended in giving his Son to dye for our ſins, and faſtned on Chriſt the foundation, receiving remiſsion of ſins,<note place="margin">Rom 5.8.10</note> and ſpiritual quickning, through beleeving on him: According to the purpoſe of God? Is there any purpoſe of God for ſending his holy Spirit to witneſs of Chriſt, to work any other kinde of faith, than this of the right kinde, or is there any faith in Chriſt of the Spirits working, that is not according to
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:135210:342"/>the purpoſe of God; doth he ſpeak of himſelf, or work otherwiſe than as proceeding from the Father and the Son? And are not theſe beleevers in their coming into Chriſt, diſtinguiſhed thereby, from all that are unbeleevers, and of the world what ever? And who will ſay, It is queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, whether the holy Spirit thus bringing any to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt, be an effect and fruit of, and flowing from the grace, love, and purpoſe of God concerning their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, even that in beleeving they might be ſaved? But theſe things have been often at large cleerlyſhewn and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before; nor doth Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> here ſay, This faith is a fruit of election; he knows that with more ſhew of truth it might be ſaid election is a fruit of this faith; but yet that is not a good and right expreſſion neither; but the teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt is, <hi>That they were choſen through the ſanctification of the Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>and the beleef of the Truth, to which they were called, &amp;c.</hi> which is already fore-ſhewn; And here yeelded in this ſaying concerning their ſalvation or election, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe two terms in a ſort, ſignifying the ſame thing, and ſo election a part of the ſalvation wrought in them and upon them, and ſo the faith the ſame ſet out, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 He ſaith, <hi>Their faith being as to the manner of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing peculiarly of the operation of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This agrees well with that ſet forth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2,, 4, 5. It was God ſure that in love gave his Son to do that for us, in and by which he is the compleat object of faith: And Jeſus Chriſt, in, and through whom God commendeth his love to us, is God, even one and the ſame God bleſſed for ever: And the Holy Ghoſt that proceedeth from the Father and the Son, is one and the ſame God, with the Father and the Son, and that the Father and the Son is: And he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering and drawing on Chriſt the foundation, and ſo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminating and affording taſtes of the heavenly gift as the effects, <hi>repentance from dead works, and faith towards God,</hi> This is certainly both his peculiar operation, and the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God. And to deny this under any ſurmiſe of an unknown purpoſe or election, were to derogate from the grace of God, even of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, as if their works in this kind, were not truly ſaving,
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:135210:343"/>and gracious, which I hope none wil ſay; ſo that this faith abideth ſtill right.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He ſaith, <hi>And as to its diſtinction from every other gift, that upon any account what ever, is ſo called, in reſpect of its fountain, termed, The faith of Gods elect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely the faith ſo ſet forth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2, 4, 5. is even ſo in reſpect of any other gifts upon any account, by men called Faith;<note place="margin">Eph. 4.4, 5. &amp; 2.8.</note> For in Scripture, we finde but one true faith, and that is the gift of God.

This I ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> never taught, nor is there any one line in Scripture to affirm it; the Spirit of God leads no man ſo to beleeve or ſpeak it, is quite and directly croſs to his Teſtimony, as is ſhewn at large, <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Page</hi> 87, 88, 89. <hi>&amp; Part.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.

                     <p>Of his ſecond Concernment.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. HE ſaith for the manner of their obtaining this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious faith, it is by Gods giving to them that holy Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this I ſhall note three things, in which it is pretended to be not only peculiar, but of another, and better kinde than the former, true in its kinde.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hee ſaith, <hi>It is by giving that Holy Spirit of his, whereby he raiſed Jeſus from the dead, to raiſe them from their death in ſin, to quicken them unto newneſs of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this firſt ſaying, we have two things to note in the manner of true beleevers obtaining faith, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, What God gives unto them, and that is that ſame
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:135210:345"/>holy Spirit of his, by which hee raiſed Jeſus from the dead.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, The end for which God gives this holy Spirit to them, and that is to raiſe them from their death in ſin; to quicken them unto newneſs of life, both which are very true, and will by all true beleevers, be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, yet the aſſerting it, as a peculiar manner of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, that is of a better kinde than that, mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. and another manner of obtaining alſo, and leaving out ſomething needful in this buſineſs to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is blame-worthy; For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 God for calling any to the faith, doth not ſend forth, or give any other ſpirit, nor is there any other ſpirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Father and the Son, than that holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which he raiſed Jeſus from the dead; This Spirit is called his <hi>Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Chriſt, the Spirit of Grace.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.19, 20. Act 7.51.</note> By this Spirit Chriſt preached in the miniſtration of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of the Prophets, whence thoſe that reſiſted his inlightnings, and teachings in thoſe miniſtrations, are ſaid to have been diſobedient to, and have reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt: And now more abundantly, ſince the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and aſcention of Chriſt, he doth in the miniſtration of the Goſpel, inlighten, call, convince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whence thoſe that ſhut their eyes, and refuſe, and deſpiſe, are ſaid to deſpiſe God:<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.7, 8. Heb. 10.29.</note> 
                     <hi>And they that after they have received the knowledge of the truth, do willingly tread under foot, the Son of God, and count the blood of the Covenant as an unholy thing, are ſaid to have done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> i.e. If it had not been the holy Spirit they had reſiſted, their ſin had not been ſo grievous; It is not good to deviſe pleas for wicked men, to extenuate their ſin. And though there be a Spirit of truth, and a ſpirit of error, yet truth is one, and the Spirit of truth is one,<note place="margin">1 Joh 4.1-6. 1 Cor. 12.4.11 2 Cor. 11.4.13.14, 15. 1 Cor 12.2, 3.</note> though his gifts be divers, and the Spirit of truth cometh onely from God and Chriſt; And no other ſpirit, but error is divers and many, and the ſpirit of error is manifold and various, and proceedeth not from God, but from the Devil. Nor can any man attain any true kinde of faith, but by the Holy Ghoſt; yea that faith mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2, 4, 5. was attained by the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:135210:345"/>of the Holy Ghoſt, and they were made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Holy Ghoſt. And to aſcribe to the Spirit the working of a faith of Chriſt dying, and by his blood ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made peace, ſuch as ſhall cauſe light, love, joy, and fill the ſoul with ſuch hope of eternal life, as ſhall raviſh the heart of a man, and inwardly and outwardly change him: And yet that Chriſt dyed not for that man, or that there is no eternal life in him for that man, nor truth, or reality in Gods intentions to give it him. Oh! yee heavens be aſtoniſhed, and let the earth tremble at this, that any ſhould ſay thus of the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of truth, or that God ſhould have two Spirits, one to work this faith, which yet cannot be true in any kinde, and a better Spirit to work a better kinde of faith; His Spirit is one, and holy, and all his operations to bring any to beleeve, like himſelf, true, real, holy, and of the right and ſaving kinde, though many reſiſt, and ſome depart. So that this line of truth, was in this buſineſs not well brought forth, ſeeing it was to oppoſe another line of truth, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the truth of the holy Spirits operations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The object diſcovered, and medium uſed by the Holy Ghoſt, for bringing any to this faith, and effecting this end mentioned, is here ſleighted and left out: That is Chriſt and him crueified, as ſet forth in the Goſpel for ſinners, to look to and beleeve in; For this is certain, firſt, That this holy Spirit teſtifieth of Chriſt, witneſſeth of his death, reſurrection, ſacrifice, exalteth, and glorifieth him, as the Son of God, the Saviour of the world,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.26, &amp; 16, 7, 8-15. Act. 5.31, 32.</note> the Prince and Saviour that giveth repentance and remiſſion of ſins to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and is a light to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and Gods ſalvation to the ends of the earth. <hi>And that whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhall receive remiſsion of ſins.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10.15.17.</note> 
                     <hi>and hearing by the word of God.</hi> The Spirit

                  <p>And let his Quotations be read, and conſidered, and they ſay no other, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:1. <hi>Peter</hi> affirms, not of ſome peculiar among beleevers, but of them all to whom hee wrote, <hi>That they obtained like precious faith with them, through the righteouſneſs of God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See Part 5. Chap. 1.</note> Sure the righteouſneſs of God is in, and through Chriſt; he promiſed him, and promiſed to aſſiſt, raiſe, glorifie him, That he ſhould call, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And God in his righteouſneſs hath done this, and according to promiſe, as he hath accepted his ſacrifice, and will accept, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all that beleeve on him. And the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt being in his oneneſs of will with the Father, to perform all that he undertook for men, and hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for beleevers, as in his oblation, interceſſion, and coming again; in all which is the righteouſneſs of God and Chriſt. And through the knowledge of this, the Apoſtles ſay,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.2, 3.</note> they received, and deſire multiplying of grace to the beleevers the ſame way; ſo as (which in the ſaying was left out) the Spirit calls tenders, inlightens, and works faith in giving forth the knowledge of the righteouſneſs of God, and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; So all that through that knowledge are brought to beleeve in Chriſt, have the ſame precious faith which the Apoſtles had; and no other kinde of faith, nor manner of obtaining; is commended by <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 The end he ſaith for which God giveth his holy
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:135210:346"/>Spirit, is very right and true; but the limiting it to ſome certain peculiar, yea unknown, and undemonſtrable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is not right, nor according to truth; nor I hope, will any ſay, God giveth his holy Spirit,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.17, &amp; 12 47. 1 Tim. 1.15 Act 26.17, 18. 2 Cor. 5.19, 20 Act. 14.17. Rom. 2.4. Job 33. Prov. 1.23. Joh. 16.29.</note> to work ſome kinde of faith in any, and not for this end here mentioned. The end of God in giving and ſending his Son into the world, <hi>was not to condemn, but to ſave the world even ſinners.</hi> The end of Chriſt his ſending his ſervants with the Goſpel to men, <hi>Is to open their eyes, and turn them from darkneſs to light, &amp;c.</hi> To reconcile their hearts by the reconciliation wrought in Chriſt; yea his mercies and chaſtiſements both, have the ſame end. So that we may be fully aſſured, that Gods end in ſending his Spirit in the Goſpel, is to ſave, convince, and ſo turn the heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that a difference of one kind of faith from another, cannot be proved by a different end of Gods ſending forth his holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>But it may be replied, The term in this ſentence, is more than ſending: It is Gods <hi>giving his holy Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.27.29.32, 33.</note> That ſuch a difference in the terms makes none in the thing; For where God is ſending the Goſpel, and demonſtrating by it, the life in Chriſt, and calling to it; He is then, and therein, ſo giving the true bread of life.</p>
                  <p>But it will be ſaid, the ſentence ſpeaks of more <hi>than gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his holy Spirit to ſuch an end, even alſo of effecting the end, endowing them with a new life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, This implies receit in them to whom given. But receit, may be in ſome men that are receivers: Not to one and the ſame end, That it is in God the giver. Truth, with the love of the Truth to ſave.<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.18.</note> Extended and given to ſome men to that end to ſave, but ſome however receiving to profeſs, and make ſome uſe of, yet they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it not to ſave them. And that ſuch do not unfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve, and ſo have not any right kind of ſaving and juſtifying faith will be granted, though ſuch, and no other, was tendred and given, if they had received it, in ſuffering the love of truth to ſave them. But for ſuch as have ſo far received the Spirit, that they are even by the Spirit affirmed, <hi>To be in the grace of Chriſt; To have received
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:135210:347"/>the Spirit of Gods Son, and to be Sons; yea to have known God,</hi>

                     <hi>and to be known of God, and to be in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free.</hi> Surely their faith was of the right kinde. And yet of theſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks after they were indued with all this, as if ſome of them were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from him that called them into the grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpel, which was not another, but a perverſion,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.6, &amp; 3.3 &amp; 4.9, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeeking to be made perfect by the fleſh, <hi>Turning again to weak and beggarly elements;</hi> inſomuch that the Apoſtle was afraid of them, <hi>leſt he had beſtowed his labour in the Goſpel on them in vain;</hi> And teſtified to them, that whoſever of them were (ſo turned back to be) <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the law,</hi>

                     <hi>Chriſt was become of no effect to them,</hi> they were fallen from grace. And this was a more applicatory charge than that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 6. and grounded upon that, which is undoubtedly found in abiding beleevers;<note place="margin">Gal. 5.5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteouſneſs by faith; for in Jeſus Chriſt, neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion; but faith which worketh by love:</hi> The perſwaſion of which abiding in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>

Nor is there any kinde of faith of the Spirits working, received, that can be called, True in its kinde, or upon account whereof any in Scripture are frequently termed Saints and beleevers, if they be not in ſome meaſure in truth endued with this. And all this in a good meaſure evidenced to be in thoſe beleevers ſo warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo in that faith and holineſs affirmed to be in

Let his quotations be conſidered:</p>

                  <p>Though this be not the dialect of Scripture, yet in a ſober underſtanding, it may be taken as agreeing thereto, but not countenancing two kindes, or a ſecond kinde of true faith.

So ſincere as makes them do worthily in their generations, their faith and holines true in its kind, and they upon account thereof called Saints and Beleevers; And yet though all this be given them of God, yet neither the Spirit, nor any of theſe his operations beſtowed on them, as a fruit of the purchaſe and interceſſion of Chriſt; How then ſhall we conceive it to be beſtowed, without ſome ſecret blaſpheming of God ſome way in his Truth and Juſtice, and teſtimony of his Son, can any man tell?

But Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>
                     <pb n="656" facs="tcp:135210:358"/>may be ſuppoſed not to deny, but that they have the holy Spirit given them as a fruit of the purchaſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Chriſt, but that it is not ſo given them to dwell and abide in them for ever, as to theſe he pleads for: And were it not for his oft and plain expreſſions elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in his book, denying the purchaſe and interceſſion of Chriſt, to be for any but theſe he pleads for, I ſhould even ſo have underſtood him; and ſuppoſe it ſo meant of the end of giving the Spirit.

Whence we are ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten exhorted to continue in the faith, and to let that we have received from the beginning abide in us, ſo ſhal we continue and abide in him, and his Spirit will abide in us, therefore are all the beleevers and holy brethren warned to take heed of ſuch unbeleevingneſs, as canſeth departure from the living God, by which ſome have deprived themſelves of this bleſſing in this gracious end of God,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.

But ſuch as he hath given to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,

                  <p>As for that aſſurance of faith, where-through the heart may be thorowly perſwaded of their perſeverance, and ſo the Spirits abiding in them for ever; It is that I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to lead all beleevers to in this Treatiſe, as may be ſeen in treating of the teſtimony of Chriſt, and of the Purpoſes, Promiſes and Covenants of God, though Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, Even thoſe of that kinde he pleadeth for, many may go without that aſſurance all their dayes, hee onely undertakes to prove notwithſtanding it ſhall ſo bee for ever.</p>
                  <p>Now let his quotations be viewed, to ſee what they ſay for one beleever more than another, for the Spirits abiding with them for ever.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Let the words be well minded, he faith not, Another Spirit, no, he mindes them of that, that it is the ſame Spirit

                  <p n="1">1 It is great,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.20, 21-23. &amp; 7.37, 38, 39. &amp; 14, 17.</note> our Saviour having prayed for the ſame bleſſing for them alſo, and promiſed the ſame, but that is not to ſome peculiar kinde of beleevers, but to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on him; not beleevers oppoſed to beleevers, but beleevers oppoſed to the world that lieth in unbeleef, as is expreſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That the manner of the aſſuring is abiding in them for ever, is by our Saviours own explication to be in their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in him,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> in that faith, love, and confidence in him, which the Spirit hath wrought, and worketh in them; and his word, that which he hath helped them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and by which he teacheth and comforteth them abiding in them: This alſo expreſs; So that by there quotations we are lead to hold faſt our firſt faith; that <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10, 11.

Their body,</hi> may be taken either for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal bodies, which were the veſſels and inſtruments, in, and with which, <hi>they were to be given up as ſervants of righteouſneſs unto God;</hi>

And thereby he ſhewed the heinouſneſs of their ſin, if they defiled their bodies with fornication and made or abuſed, <hi>The members of Chriſt, to be one with, and the members of an harlot:</hi>

                  <p>Now what was the Regeneration of Chriſt, ſurely he needed none of heart, ſpirit, or diſpoſition, he was holy in, and from conception, and knew no ſin, but he had a weak, frail and mortal body, of the ſeed of <hi>David, Abraham, Adam;</hi> and how was that regenerated, but through many ſufferings and death in the reſurrection from the dead:<note place="margin">Luke 24.26.45, 46, 47.

                  <p>In which are many things, encouraging both him; and them, to pray to God in the name of Chriſt: As the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatneſſe of the power of God that gave, and raiſed Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.19 22 &amp; 2.17, 18, 19 22.

                  <p>And Laſtly, That in putting his word in their heart and inabling them to beleeve and confeſſe the ſame, hee hath put his name upon them, ſo farre, that hee is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee called their God and Father, and they called his
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:135210:371"/>people, and the declarers of his name, which with the reſt, gives great conſolation, ſeeing hee hath promiſed to hear his people, that are called by his name, when they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves and pray, and ſeek his face, and pray towards, or in the houſe that is called by his name,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 7.12-14 &amp; 6.20-41</note> which as the old was a tipe, ſignifies Chriſt and his people, and ſo to pray in faith in the Name of Chriſt, and in union with, and love of the brethren:<note place="margin">Joh. 16.23 Mar. 11.24, 25 Pſal. 65.1-4.</note> Hee being a God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayers, and they bleſſed whom he chooſeth, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to approach to him, that they may dwell in his houſe for they ſhall bee ſatified.

So that all the Family of God is named of Chriſt, is expreſs here, and that God hath put his Name on them, is true, Inſtructive, Conſolatory, and Admonitory: But when thus expreſt, called by the name of God, there needs ſome cautions to prevent vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits &amp;c. for they are not called <hi>Jehovah;</hi> or God, or the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Jeſus, or the Chriſt, or the Holy Ghoſt, or the Creator of all things, or the Redeemer of mankind, or the ſanctifier of Gods choſen, or the Lord of hoaſts, or the Almighty, or the Truth Love, Wiſdome it ſelf, &amp;c. no not ſo; but the Name put on them, is the Name of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his goodneſſe, in his Doctrin, of which they are made Beleevers and profeſſors, and ſo hee is called their God. Father, Saviour; &amp;c. And they his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his People, Sons, Chriſtians, &amp;c. And yet here is another caution, namely that this family will one day bee more pure, and have a new name given them after their total victory and conqueſt or his Name put on them in a more glorious manner, when that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. will bee compleatly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled as is there promiſed, when without controverſie, there will bee amongſt them no finne, nor poſſibility of ſinning, or falling: but the family on earth is not ſo yet, and though the ſpirits of juſt men bee perfect, and under
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:135210:372"/>the Altar, and out of all danger, yet want they their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and ſo that fulneſſe they ſhall enjoy in the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the juſt. But that part of the family that is here below, are yet in mortal bodies, and ſo are not yet any of them altogether without ſin, nor are all things that offend yet purged out, the beleevers and Saints, in and of this part of the family here on earth, are yet in a warfare, beſet with enemies, within, and without, temptations from luſts within, terrours and allurements, from the world without, Satan and his Miniſters, with pretences of light, ſtriving to ſeduce them from the faith, and to turn them out of the way, whence they are often warned from God, to ſtand faſt in the faith, to be ſober, and watchful, to put on the whole Armor of God, to fight the good fight of Faith, to cleave to Chriſt in whom there is compleatneſs for them, to ſow to the ſpirit, of whom they ſhall reap life everlaſting. And to take heed that they bee not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and that they depart not through an evil heart of unbeleefe, and many ſuch warnings, with ground of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now of this part of the family here on earth; and of the faith and holineſſe in them, and ſo of ſuch beleevers and Saints, is our whole diſcourſe: And ſo in the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy between ſome brethren; The Queſtion is? whether, ſuch as are admitted into this family, in that part of it, that is here below, and have the name of God and Chriſt ſo put on them, as it is put on his people here below? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may not, by neglect of their watch, and the warning given them, bee overcome to ſuch degrees of ſinning, as to depart from the faith, and ſo bee caſt out of this family, and have this name taken off them again?</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, Oh that none more might! but yet wee need to bee heedful: for if we look at our tipes, as the Temple and place God choſe for his worſhip, and put his name there, was a tipe of thoſe by faith built on Chriſt.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.3.5</note> So its not without its uſe to us, that where God ſets his name at the firſt; yet for the wickedneſſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there,<note place="margin">Jer. 7.10-14</note> he removed it away from thence: And threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to do the ſame (yea hee hath done it) to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>

And are not theſe things writ for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and warnings to us: but to leave preſſing the tipes, and come nigher even to the truth it ſelf: If this family be the kingdome of God here on earth, as I ſuppoſe none queſtions; then what means that ſaying of our Saviour.<note place="margin">Mat. 8.11, 12</note>

                  <p n="2">2 That in his firſt kinde of faith, there are ſo many mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures put in, that are no efficacies of the holy Spirit in the Goſpel, nor any parts of faith at all, and if they be taken as ingredients and parts of the faith he mentions, then is that faith he calls really true in its kinde, no faith at all in Scripture language, nor any there, on the account of ſuch a faith, called Beleevers and Saints; nor is it the faith pleaded for, and called ſaving, by thoſe he oppoſeth. And if thoſe mixtures be removed and left out, and that ſtand for the faith true in its kinde, which is ſo indeed, then it is one and the ſame, with all that he ſaith of the ſecond kinde of faith, that is by Scripture found true indeed, and then he hath ſecretly, yet plainly, yeelded all that, which through his book he oppoſeth in another; for this faith hee yeeldeth men may fall from.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That in his ſecond kinde of faith, he hath put in ſtrange and unſcripture-like expreſſions, and aſſertions, in every of his Concernments, ſpecially the former three of them, which being taken as neceſſary to the being of this ſecond kinde of faith, that it may be true in its kinde, then is there no ſuch faith and holineſs ſet forth in the Scripture, nor any ſuch beleevers and Saints on this earth, what ever by fancy or mans approbation ſome may conceive: Nor doth all or any of the quotations, expreſs or prove ſuch a faith according to the terms aſſerted, to differ it from the firſt kinde, ſo that the faith and holineſs, the perſeverance whereof (ſuch as no poſſibility of falling away) he aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, is ſuch a faith as is not, as no man hath, otherwiſe then by conceit, a fancy which thoſe he oppoſeth, never vented, to bring it within the liſts of a controverſie. And ſo in ſtriving for this, he was quite beſides the buſineſs in controverſie, to give any anſwer thereto, the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not about fancy, but truth: As for the reaſon why he thus ſtated the queſtion, as to evade the buſineſs, I leave
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:135210:374"/>that to himſelf, and others to conſider.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That in both his kindes of faith, I find that that which is true, and which the quotations to them, do either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs or prove for to be ſaith; It is for the kinde of it, in both, but one and the ſame kinde of faith, (as hath been fully ſhewn in treating of both) onely it is ſo darkned, by the mixtures, put in the one, and the ſtrange expreſſions, and lofty terms put in the other, that no man that taketh all hee ſaith for truth, can ſee any door for him to come into the faith, or any certain way to know when he hath it; yea it will more hinder ſuch as have it not, from faith, and ſuch as have it, from perſeverance, then all ſaid by him whom he oppoſeth, and leaves men for their conſolation, to their fancy, and the judgment of their Rabbies, to relye on, whereas the faith that is true, ſaving and juſtifying, is cleerly ſet forth in the Scripture in the teſtimony of Chriſt, as in this Treatiſe hath been ſhewn in every part thereof, let the Scriptures quoted be read, and their expreſſions beleeved, and ſo let the Reader diſcern, and judge accordingly.</p>
                  <p>If any reply, <hi>That when there is a controverſie about faith, It is then needful to ſtate the queſtion, that it may be ſeen what is pleaded for, and who plead for the true faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſwer,</hi> The object and foundation of faith being diſcovered in the plain ſayings of the Goſpel, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beleef, and acknowledgement of that ſtood for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to plain ſayings in the Goſpel, the queſtion is well ſtated in the plain affirmations of the Goſpel, and none need require any other ſtating of the queſtion but ſuch as cannot indure to ſtand to thoſe ſayings, from which none that are wiſe will be waved: And the truth is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie was not about the faith it ſelf, but about the poſſibility or impoſsibility of ſuch as at any time have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to beleeve, to fall away again, that ſo help may accordingly be adminiſtred to them, and they exhorted to receive and uſe the ſame, to prevent danger; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of true faith, is an invention brought in, to ſtrengthen the purſuit of the controverſie; and who ſhall ſtate a queſtion for two kindes of faith, true in their kinde,
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:135210:374"/>when there is but one, and what will become of all that is builded on a queſtion ſo ſtated? or who that is wiſe will regard it to be waved by it: Judge: But if any will ſtill bee violent to have the queſtion ſtated, let them firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and plainly anſwer this one queſtion, namely,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> What they do indeed mean by faith, whether the object of faith, or the grace of beleeving in that object; for this is cleer in the Scripture, That as our Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding, and truſting, and hoping in God, was called their <hi>Truſt,</hi> and their <hi>Hope,</hi> ſo alſo God himſelf in whom they truſted, is by them confeſſed their <hi>Hope,</hi> and their <hi>Truſt:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 71.5. Jer. 17.17. Pſal. 40.4. 1 Tim. 1.1.</note> And he is pronounced <hi>Bleſſed, that maketh the Lord his Truſt.</hi> And ſo now God hath ſent forth his Son, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up his dwelling in him the Man Jeſus Chriſt, he is therefore likewiſe called, <hi>God our Saviour, and Lord Jeſus Chriſt our hope; And ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, and Saviour of the world, as he hath taken the nature of man, and dyed for our ſins, and roſe for our juſtification offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the acceptable ſacrifice, ſitteth at the right hand of God, filled with Spirit, &amp;c. So as who ever beleeveth in him, ſhall receive forgiveneſs of ſins, &amp;c.</hi> This the object of faith, and the teſtimony of Chriſt in the Goſpel holding forth this, being that in which he is diſcovered and diſcerned, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving of which, beleeved and received, that is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate object of faith, and Chriſt thus ſet forth in, and by the Goſpel, is called, <hi>The faith,</hi> even the ſame faith that <hi>Paul</hi> did once perſecute, and after preach. And this faith is one, and but one.</p>
                  <p>But I ſuppoſe the controverſie is not about this, though the evil managing the controverſie, hath ſtrengthned many in denying this. But here the buſineſs controverted, is about the grace of beleeving. Now every beleeving is not faith, but that which is begotten by the declaration of the object of faith, and in beleeving it cloſeth with it. And ſo faith is ſtill one, as hath been ſhewn at large. Part 3. Chap. 17. and elſewhere. And ſo if anſwer bee given, That by faith is meant ſuch a beleeving as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the teſtimony of Chriſt, and cloſeth with Chriſt in that teſtimony, then ſure the Queſtion is ſtated in the
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:135210:375"/>Anſwer given, but if it be urged, it need to be better ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: I anſwer it hath been often ſhewn, how the Scripture doth it, in many places plainly; and ſo far to yeeld to all that is right even in tradition of Fathers alſo. Its known what ſome of them have ſaid, and others from them have preached who have ſaid the right beleef is this,</p>
                  <p>A beleeving God to Bee, and beleeving of God, in that which he ſaith, and beleeving in God for all he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: This, all this, nothing leſs than this, is ſaid to bee a right beleef; True it is, He that beleeveth not God to bee, and Jehovah to be that very true God, is as an Atheiſt, and hath no true beleef at all.</p>
                  <p>But he that beleeveth God to be, and Jehovah to bee that very God, doth ſo far beleeve a right; yet if he beleeve him not true in his ſayings, and demonſtrations of his goodneſs, he is yet wanting of a right beleef, yea his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving is not ſaving without this.</p>
                  <p>If he beleeveth both theſe, his beleeving is right and ſaving, and if he abide in it, and minde what he beleeveth, it will ſave him ſo as to bring him to beleeve in God for what he promiſeth, which when he attaineth, he beginneth to bee ſaved ſo far as he is a true beleever and hath faith, even true faith: And as I conceive the Scripture it ſelf alſo holds forth this in <hi>Heb</hi> 11.6. <hi>For he that cometh to God, muſt beleeve that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſeek him:</hi> Here is the beleef of his being expreſs, and the beleef of his ſayings, in his demonſtrated goodneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs &amp; beleeving in him, intimated in coming to him. And this to prove faith in <hi>Henoch,</hi> and in his time, when though all the goodneſs of God to man-ward was through a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, yet the Mediator, and his work was not then ſo clearly revealed as ſince, Jeſus Chriſt carried our nature into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>and the fulnes of the God-head dwels in him bodily;</hi> of which his firſt witneſſes have teſtified, ſaying, <hi>We know that the Son of God is come,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Joh. 5.20.</note> 
                     <hi>and hath given us an underſtanding that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt; This is the true God, and eternal life:</hi> So then we have not another faith, or an other manner of beleeving, but the ſame object of faith brought nigher,
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:135210:375"/>and ſet forth more cleerly, to be in the ſame manner more firmly beleeved in, even God in Chriſt, and ſo Chriſt, and God in him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 To beleeve this publick man to be, even the ſecond man, the Lord from heaven, the ſpiritual man, that hath in himſelf as the publick man, ſuffered for the ſins of mankinde, that came in by the firſt publick mans tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and reſtored the nature of man, and preſented it ſpotleſs in himſelf before the Father, and the Father hath taken his wel pleaſedneſs, and dwelling in him, and ſet him forth the propitiation for the ſins of the world, the Savior of the world. <hi>That whoever beleeve in him may have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, And that Jeſus is this Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 To beleeve his ſayings by his Spirit in the Goſpel, all true and good, the very ſayings of the God of truth in, and by him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 To beleeve in him, in Chriſt Jeſus, in his blood, and ſo in God, in him for all that he hath promiſed, and ſo for the Kingdome to come, this according to the deſcription of the Ancient, is Evangelical faith, not another kinde, but the ſame more bright and fully appearing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, all which hath been ſhewn in firſt, ſecond, third, and fourth parts of this Treatiſe, yea in the reſidue alſo at large.</p>
                  <p>And though, as at firſt mentioned, it is accepted where this glorious Goſpel is not given, yet where it is diſplayed, if the firſt be wanting, there is no right Goſpel-beleeving, but that beleeved with the heart, will effect the other two, which being in any meaſure effected, ſuch do not onely beleeve truly, but are true beleevers, and have right faith, that is ſaving and juſtifying.</p>
                  <p>And as for Scripture-ſtating, and explicating the queſtion, it is oft ſhewn already, and all agreeing with that here ſaid, to ſet it forth by a definition, I will not preſume, onely the neareſt that I finde of that nature, I will mention, it is in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Now faith is the ſubſtance</hi> (ground or confidence) <hi>of things hoped for, the evidence of
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:135210:376"/>things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> By faith here, it is cleer, is meant ſuch a beleef of Gods evidenced goodneſs, as is begotten by his own declaration, evidence, or teſtimony and cloſeth with the ſame in beleeving, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his evidence given. And that he ſpeaks of the object of faith evidenced by divine teſtimony, received and cloſed with in beleeving, is evident throughout the whole Epiſtle, of which evidences through mediums, in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of that report in Paradiſe, the evidences in works of Creation and Providence were the firſt, and then more fully by word and oracles, and then moſt full and clear by his Son, the ſtanding teſtimony of whom is in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel as now come forth, and this is plain, Chap. 1.1, 2, 3, &amp; 2.1, 2, 3, 4. &amp; 12.25. of faith begot by evidences, through the firſt mediums: Examples in this 11.
